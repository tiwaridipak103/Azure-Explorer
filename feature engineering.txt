We are working on Moody's dataset with multiple features and responses for each market.It is quarterly data that means, that every quarter, new record come for each market .It is real estate dataset.
I am currently working with feature name Per_Capita_Income and response vacancy. Help me understand how it works
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — this is an important variable in real estate economics. Let’s break it down carefully from economic logic → real estate interpretation → statistical behavior → feature engineering potential for your Moody’s dataset.

🧩 1. Understanding the Feature
Feature: Per_Capita_Income
Definition:
It measures the average income earned per person in a market (typically a city or metro area) in a given quarter.

Formally:

Per Capita Income
=
Total Income of Residents
Total Population
Per Capita Income= 
Total Population
Total Income of Residents
​
 
It reflects economic prosperity and spending power of people in that region.

🏢 2. Relationship to Vacancy Rate (response variable)
📈 a. General Direction (Inverse Relationship)
Typically, as per capita income increases, vacancy rates (for apartments, offices, retail, etc.) tend to decrease because:

Higher income → higher affordability → more demand for housing and commercial space.

Businesses also expand when local income rises, leading to higher occupancy in offices and retail properties.

Higher Per Capita Income
⇒
Lower Vacancy Rate
Higher Per Capita Income⇒Lower Vacancy Rate
📉 b. Exceptions (Market-Specific or Time-Dependent)
If income growth is driven by a few high earners, not the general population → demand might not rise broadly.

In overheated markets (e.g., San Francisco, NYC), high income might already correlate with high property prices, leading to some affordability-based vacancies.

During booms, both income and new construction rise; temporary oversupply can increase vacancies despite rising income.

Hence, the lag between income and vacancy can matter — vacancy may improve 1–2 quarters after income rises.

🔁 3. Dynamic Effects in Time Series (Quarterly)
Because your dataset is quarterly, you can model lagged and growth effects:

Feature Type	Example	Interpretation
Lagged income	Per_Capita_Income_t-1, t-2	Captures delayed demand response
Quarterly change	ΔPCI = PCI_t - PCI_t-1	Measures income momentum
YoY growth	(PCI_t - PCI_t-4) / PCI_t-4	Smooths seasonal noise
Income volatility	Rolling std(PCI, 4q)	Captures income stability and uncertainty
🧠 4. How it Works in Each Property Segment
Property Type	Mechanism	Typical Effect
Apartments (Residential)	Rising income → more renters can afford better units or buy homes → short-term vacancy may drop but long-term depend on housing starts	Moderate negative relationship
Offices	Higher income → stronger local businesses and professional jobs → office demand ↑	Strong negative relationship
Retail	Higher consumer income → higher retail sales → store expansions → vacancy ↓	Strong negative relationship
Industrial	Income growth → consumption ↑ → logistics demand ↑	Mild negative relationship
🧮 5. Statistical Correlation Check
You can check empirically:

df.groupby('Market')['Per_Capita_Income'].corr(df['Vacancy'])
If most markets show negative correlation, that supports the economic expectation.

Also check lag correlation:

for lag in [0,1,2,3,4]:
    corr = df['Per_Capita_Income'].shift(lag).corr(df['Vacancy'])
    print(f"Lag {lag}: {corr}")
Often lag 1–2 quarters show strongest effects.

🧰 6. Out-of-the-Box Feature Engineering Ideas
Here’s how top real estate firms (like CBRE, Moody’s, and CoStar) build enhanced income-based features:

Income-to-Rent Affordability Ratio

Affordability
=
Per Capita Income
Average Rent
Affordability= 
Average Rent
Per Capita Income
​
 
High affordability → vacancy ↓.

Real Income Growth (Inflation-Adjusted)

Real PCI
=
Per Capita Income
CPI
Real PCI= 
CPI
Per Capita Income
​
 
Measures true purchasing power.

Income vs. Housing Supply Elasticity
Ratio of income growth to housing completions — helps see if supply matches demand.

Relative Income Position
Compare a market’s income to the national median:

Income Ratio
=
PCI
m
a
r
k
e
t
PCI
U
S
Income Ratio= 
PCI 
US
​
 
PCI 
market
​
 
​
 
Measures competitiveness of each market.

Income Inequality Adjustment
If Gini index or distribution data available, weight PCI by middle-income share — helps detect uneven prosperity.

⚙️ 7. Model Insights
When modeling, this variable can act as:

Demand-side driver for all property types.

Early indicator (leading signal) for vacancy improvements.

Interaction variable with employment or housing supply.

Example interactions:

Per_Capita_Income * Employment_Rate

Per_Capita_Income / Median_Rent

ΔPCI * ΔPopulation
