We are working on Moody's dataset with multiple features and responses for each market.It is quarterly data that means, that every quarter, new record come for each market .It is real estate dataset.
I am currently working with feature name average_hourly_earning_private and response vacancy. Help me understand how it works
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — let’s unpack this carefully and deeply.

You’re working with Moody’s real estate dataset (quarterly, multi-market, multi-feature), and focusing on the relationship between:

Feature: average_hourly_earning_private

Response: vacancy (vacancy rate of properties)

🔍 Step 1. Understanding the Feature
average_hourly_earning_private
This represents the average hourly earnings of private sector employees — i.e., what workers in the private sector earn per hour on average.
It reflects:

Wage growth

Labor market strength

Inflationary pressures

Consumer spending potential

In Real Estate Context
Private sector earnings drive demand-side fundamentals of property markets:

Economic Effect	Mechanism	Impact on Vacancy
Higher wages → higher disposable income	People can afford rent or mortgage more easily.	↓ Vacancy (less empty space)
Higher wages → business cost pressure	Firms might reduce hiring or delay expansion if wages rise too fast.	↑ Vacancy (especially in offices)
Higher wages → inflationary environment	Central banks might raise rates → higher borrowing costs → less construction or slower investment.	Mixed effect depending on market phase
Sector-specific effect	Certain markets (tech, finance hubs) are more sensitive to wage trends.	Varies by market
📊 Step 2. How It Interacts with Vacancy
Vacancy = unoccupied real estate space proportion (e.g., % of units or sqft available but not leased).

The relationship is often non-linear and lagged, because labor and property markets adjust slowly.

Typical Dynamics:
Lagged Response:
Wage growth now may influence vacancy 1–3 quarters later — as tenants renew leases, consumers adjust spending, and developers react.

Use lag features:
avg_hourly_earning_private_lag1, lag2, etc.

Differential Impact by Property Type:

Office: correlated with corporate profitability and employment → more sensitive

Retail: follows consumer spending

Apartment: follows household income → negative correlation with vacancy

Industrial: follows production & e-commerce → less directly tied to wages

Cross-market sensitivity:
Markets with high-income workers (NY, SF) may react differently than lower-wage markets.

🧠 Step 3. What to Expect Empirically
If you run a regression or correlation:

Property Type	Expected Sign of Coefficient (approx.)	Interpretation
Apartment	Negative	Higher wages → more affordability → lower vacancy
Retail	Negative or Mixed	Higher wages → more spending, but inflation can offset
Office	Negative (with lag)	Higher earnings → strong firms → more space demand
Industrial	Weak/Indirect	Driven more by logistics than wages
🧩 Step 4. Suggested Feature Engineering
To make this feature richer and more “industry-grade”, you can derive advanced variables:

Category	Engineered Feature	Economic Meaning
Growth rate	qoq_change = (current - previous)/previous	Detect wage momentum
Lag features	lag_1, lag_2, lag_4	Capture delayed vacancy response
Deviation from trend	actual - rolling_mean(4q)	Wage shocks (unexpected change)
Ratio features	avg_hourly_earning_private / avg_hourly_earning_public	Wage gap between private and public sectors
Elasticity indicator	Interaction: avg_hourly_earning_private * employment_rate	Labor income power jointly
Real wage	avg_hourly_earning_private / CPI	Adjust for inflation
Market relative feature	(market_value - national_avg)	Local wage competitiveness
Volatility	std(earnings over last 4 quarters)	Stability of income in a region
📈 Step 5. How to Analyze
Correlation & Lags:

Compute correlation of vacancy with lagged earnings features.

Plot cross-correlation function (CCF) to find optimal lag.

Causal Interpretation:

Test if wage shocks cause vacancy changes using Granger causality or causal discovery.

Be careful with endogeneity — wage growth may itself depend on local economic health (simultaneous causality).

💡 Step 6. Real-World Example
In 2021–2022, U.S. private hourly earnings rose sharply post-COVID:

Residential rents increased → lower vacancy in apartments.

Office sector saw mixed results — wage growth didn’t offset remote work.

Retail vacancy improved in suburban areas due to higher household income.

So the relationship is contextual, but the sign and timing depend on market and property type.

Would you like me to go one step further and show:

🔢 a feature engineering pipeline (in code or pseudo-code), or

📊 a visual causal interpretation diagram (how earnings connect to vacancy through mediators like employment, inflation, and interest rates)?

Perfect — let’s go for “out-of-the-box” feature engineering ideas for average_hourly_earning_private, the kind of advanced transformations that top real estate analytics teams (like Moody’s, CBRE, or CoStar) use to extract deeper insights from labor market variables.

We’ll move beyond just lags and growth rates — and create macro-financial, behavioral, and cross-market features that connect private earnings to vacancy in real estate markets.

🧠 1. Momentum & Trend Features
Feature	Formula / Idea	Real Estate Insight
Earnings Growth (QoQ & YoY)	(E_t - E_{t-1}) / E_{t-1} and (E_t - E_{t-4}) / E_{t-4}	Measures wage momentum — rapid wage growth may precede tightening labor markets → ↓ vacancy
Earnings Acceleration	(QoQ_growth_t - QoQ_growth_{t-1})	Detects turning points — sudden acceleration signals strong demand
Rolling Average & Trend Deviation	E_t - rolling_mean(E, 4)	Captures “shock” in wages beyond trend
🔁 2. Lagged & Lead Features (Behavioral Delay)
Feature	Idea	Use
Lag_1, Lag_2, Lag_3, Lag_4	Earnings from previous quarters	Vacancy responds to wage shifts with delay
Forward Earnings (Lead)	Use future data in modeling scenario testing	Simulates impact of projected wage growth
💵 3. Real Income–Adjusted Features
Feature	Formula	Why It Matters
Real Average Hourly Earnings	E_t / CPI_t	Adjusts for inflation — nominal wage gains may not translate into higher purchasing power
Disposable Income Proxy	E_t * EmploymentRate_t * (1 - TaxRate_t)	Links earnings to actual spending capacity
Affordability Index (Earnings-to-Rent)	E_t / MedianRent_t	Measures how affordable housing is for workers → strong negative link with vacancy
🧩 4. Cross-Market and Spatial Features
Feature	Formula / Idea	Real Estate Logic
Market Relative Wage Index	(E_market_t / E_national_t)	Measures if a market’s wage level is above or below national average
Regional Spillover Wage Index	Average wages of neighboring markets (weighted by distance)	Captures cross-market labor competition
Rank-based Feature	Market’s percentile rank in wage growth	Helps detect “hot labor markets” driving local demand
🏭 5. Structural / Sectoral Interaction Features
Feature	Combination	Interpretation
Wage × Employment	E_t * EmploymentPrivate_t	Total wage bill → better proxy for aggregate income
Wage × Education Employment	E_t * Education_Health_Services_Employment	High-earning, stable sector → sustained demand
Wage × Office Employment Share	E_t * (OfficeEmployment / TotalEmployment)	Captures wage pressure specifically from office-using sectors
Wage × Consumer Confidence Index	Interaction with sentiment	Measures how wage perception amplifies spending behavior
⏳ 6. Cyclical and Smoothing Features
Feature	Description	Insight
Hodrick–Prescott (HP) Filter Trend Component	Extract smooth trend from wage series	Identifies long-term wage trajectory vs short-term noise
HP Cycle Component	Short-term cyclical deviations	Detects cyclical overheating or softening of labor market
Wage Volatility (Rolling Std)	std(E_t over past 4 or 8 quarters)	Wage instability can reduce confidence → higher vacancy risk
📉 7. Macro-Financial Derived Features
Feature	Formula / Idea	Economic Rationale
Wage–Interest Rate Spread	E_t / FedFundsRate_t	How fast wages are rising vs borrowing cost
Wage–Productivity Gap	E_t / IndustrialProductionIndex_t	Indicates wage pressure beyond productivity — can squeeze firms
Wage–Inflation Gap	E_t / CPI_t_growth	High real wage gains = more purchasing power → ↓ vacancy
Wage Elasticity Proxy	ΔVacancy / ΔEarnings (estimated empirically)	Quantifies market sensitivity to wage shifts
🏠 8. Demand & Affordability Hybrid Features
Feature	Description	Why Useful
Housing Demand Index	(Real_Wage * PopulationGrowth) / HousingSupplyGrowth	Integrates wage growth into demand fundamentals
Office Absorption Proxy	(E_t * OfficeEmployment_t) / OfficeStock_t	Wage growth + job creation → office space absorption
Retail Sales Potential	(E_t * Employment_t * ConsumerConfidence_t)	Combines wage strength with sentiment and jobs
🔬 9. Nonlinear Transformations
Transformation	Reason
log(E_t)	Stabilizes variance, interpretable in % changes
sqrt(E_t) or E_t^2	Capture diminishing or amplifying returns
z-score normalized by market	Compare across cities/markets consistently
interaction with time trend	To detect structural breaks (e.g., post-COVID wage regime shift)
🧮 10. AI/ML Derived Features
Technique	Description	Usage
Principal Component on Labor Features	Combine wages, employment, productivity into latent “Labor Market Strength”	Captures multi-dimensional effect
K-Means on Wage Patterns	Cluster markets by wage trajectory	Different cluster behaviors can explain vacancy variation
Residual from Wage Forecast Model	actual - predicted	Wage surprises or shocks as driver of short-term vacancy changes
🧭 Practical Example (Pseudo-Code Style)
# Assume df has columns: ['market', 'quarter', 'avg_hourly_earning_private', 'CPI', 'employment', 'median_rent']

df['wage_qoq'] = df.groupby('market')['avg_hourly_earning_private'].pct_change(1)
df['wage_yoy'] = df.groupby('market')['avg_hourly_earning_private'].pct_change(4)
df['wage_accel'] = df['wage_qoq'] - df.groupby('market')['wage_qoq'].shift(1)

df['real_wage'] = df['avg_hourly_earning_private'] / df['CPI']
df['affordability_index'] = df['avg_hourly_earning_private'] / df['median_rent']
df['wage_volatility'] = df.groupby('market')['avg_hourly_earning_private'].rolling(4).std().reset_index(level=0, drop=True)

df['market_relative_wage'] = df['avg_hourly_earning_private'] / df.groupby('quarter')['avg_hourly_earning_private'].transform('mean')
Would you like me to now suggest which of these engineered features typically have the strongest predictive relationship with vacancy (based on evidence from commercial real estate models)?
That way, I can help you prioritize the top 5–7 most powerful transformations before you start coding them.

You said:
Sorry I was asking can you look for some more top notch features engineering which top real estate industry use
ChatGPT said:
Excellent clarification — you’re asking for next-level, “top-tier” feature engineering — the kind that’s used by elite real estate analytics teams (think Moody’s Analytics, CoStar, BlackRock, JLL Research, and REIS).

Let’s go well beyond standard econometric features and get into the macro-structural, behavioral, and financial-engineering-inspired transformations that these firms actually use in their proprietary vacancy and rent models.

We’ll keep the focus on average_hourly_earning_private as the base feature and design industry-grade engineered variables that capture how wage dynamics ripple through labor, consumption, credit, and space demand.

🏗️ 1. Labor Market Power Features (Macro Strength Indicators)
🧩 1.1 Labor Income Index

e
t
−
Weighted Avg Wage of Nearby Markets
Wage Gradient=Avg Wage 
Market
​
 −Weighted Avg Wage of Nearby Markets
Why: Captures inter-market labor arbitrage — if neighboring cities pay much less, high-wage markets attract talent → lower apartment vacancy but higher office cost pressure.

🧩 2.3 “Cost of Living–Adjusted Wage”
Formula:

Adj Wage
=
Avg Hourly Earnings
Cost of Living Index
Adj Wage= 
Cost of Living Index
Avg Hourly Earnings
​
 
Why: Measures net real attractiveness of a market. High adjusted wage = migration inflow → ↓ vacancy (especially residential).

📉 3. Financial & Inflation Transmission Features
🧩 3.1 Wage–Interest Rate Ratio
Formula:

Wage–Rate Ratio
=
Avg Hourly Earnings
10-Year Treasury Rate
Wage–Rate Ratio= 
10-Year Treasury Rate
Avg Hourly Earnings
​
 
Why: Indicates affordability vs. borrowing cost; high ratio means earnings are growing faster than debt burden → strong demand.

🧩 3.2 Wage–Inflation Differential
Formula:

Wage–Inflation Gap
=
Wage Growth
−
CPI Growth
Wage–Inflation Gap=Wage Growth−CPI Growth
Why: Real wage growth positive = affordability improvement → residential/retail vacancy falls.

🧩 3.3 Wage–Equity Market Co-movement
Formula:
Rolling correlation (4Q or 8Q) between avg_hourly_earning_private and SP500_Price_Index.
Why: Captures macro cycle synchronization — both wages and equities rise in expansions → demand expansion across property types.

🧱 4. Behavioral & Sentiment-Based Features
🧩 4.1 Wage Optimism Index
Formula:
Interaction of wage growth with Consumer Confidence Index (CCI):

Optimism Index
=
Wage Growth
×
CCI
Optimism Index=Wage Growth×CCI
Why: Converts wage data into psychological purchasing power; high optimism amplifies income effect on space absorption.

🧩 4.2 Wage Volatility (Labor Uncertainty)
Formula:
Rolling standard deviation of earnings growth over last 8 quarters.
Why: Wage instability → cautious consumers and firms → higher vacancy risk.

🧩 4.3 Structural Break Feature
Idea:
Include a dummy or spline when wages structurally shift (e.g., post-COVID wage surge).
Why: Detect regime changes — vacancy elasticity differs across economic regimes.

🏭 5. Industry-Level Spillover Features
🧩 5.1 Wage-to-Office Employment Ratio
Ratio
=
Avg Hourly Earnings
Office-Using Employment Share
Ratio= 
Office-Using Employment Share

Public Sector Wages
Premium= 
Public Sector Wages
Private Sector Wages
​
 
Why: Reflects market dynamism — private sector strength correlates with commercial real estate activity.

🧭 6. Income Distribution & Inequality Features
🧩 6.1 Gini-Adjusted Earnings
If income distribution data is available:

AdjEarnings
=
AvgEarnings
×
(
1
−
Gini
)
AdjEarnings=AvgEarnings×(1−Gini)
Why: Controls for inequality — markets with more equitable income distribution show steadier demand.

🧩 6.2 Median-to-Mean Earnings Ratio
Why: Detects skew — high skew markets (tech hubs) may have volatile vacancy due to concentrated wage earners.

🧮 7. Market Competitiveness and Attractiveness Features
Feature	Formula / Description	Real Estate Implication

You said:
So me some more features engineering with average_hourly_earning_private.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — let’s go even deeper into industry-grade, creative, and data-science-driven feature engineering specifically around
📈 average_hourly_earning_private
for real estate modeling (especially vacancy prediction).

We’ll now look at features used or inspired by top-tier economic research, institutional RE firms (Moody’s, CBRE, CoStar, BlackRock), and macro-labor econometrics — going beyond even what we covered earlier.

🔮 1. Macro-Cycle Interaction Features
🧩 1.1 Wage–Business Cycle Alignment Index
Formula:
Rolling correlation (8 or 12 quarters) between wage growth and GDP growth.
Intuition: Measures whether wage growth is pro-cyclical (moving with economy).

High correlation → expansion phase → ↓ vacancy

Low or negative → wage rigidity or downturn → ↑ vacancy

🧩 1.2 Wage–Unemployment Divergence
Formula:
Wage Growth – (−Δ Unemployment Rate)
Why: When wages rise while unemployment also rises → cost-push inflation without job growth (bad for demand).
Use: Leading indicator for office and retail vacancy.

🧩 1.3 Wage Shock Index
Formula:
Actual Wage Growth – Predicted Wage Growth (predicted from long-term trend or ARIMA model).
Why: Captures unexpected shifts in wage trends (supply shocks).

Positive shock = more spending → ↓ vacancy

Negative shock = stagnation → ↑ vacancy

💰 2. Labor Income Distribution & Quality Metrics
🧩 2.1 Wage Dispersion (Inequality)
If you have quantile data (P90/P10):

Dispersion
=
P
90
P
10
Dispersion= 
P10
P90
​
 
Why: High inequality reduces overall purchasing stability → more vacancy risk in mass-market residential.

🧩 2.2 High-Wage Employment Share
Share
=
Employment in High-Wage Industries
Total Employment
Share= 
Total Employment
Employment in High-Wage Industries
​
 
Why: Reflects market resilience — more high-income workers = stable apartment and office demand.

🧩 2.3 Wage–Skill Premium
Premium
=
Avg Wage in Skilled Services
Avg Wage in Manufacturing
Premium= 
Avg Wage in Manufacturing
Avg Wage in Skilled Services
​
 
Why: Measures structural shift toward knowledge economy — correlated with office space absorption.

🏠 3. Housing Market Interaction Features
🧩 3.1 Wage-to-Mortgage-Cost Ratio
Ratio
=
Avg Hourly Earnings
Mortgage Rate
×
Home Price Index
Ratio= 
Mortgage Rate×Home Price Index
Avg Hourly Earnings
​
 
Why: Captures affordability power of income vs financing cost.

High ratio → improved buying power → ↓ apartment vacancy.

🧩 3.2 Wage-to-Rent Differential (Pressure on Ownership Shift)
Diff
=
Wage Growth
−
Rent Growth
Diff=Wage Growth−Rent Growth
Why: If wages rise faster than rent → renters can afford homes → potential rise in vacancy for rental markets.

🧩 3.3 Housing Absorption Power Index
Absorption Index
=
Avg Hourly Earnings
×
Population Growth
Housing Stock Growth
Absorption Index= 
Housing Stock Growth
Avg Hourly Earnings×Population Growth
​
 
Why: Encapsulates income + demographics + supply → directly predicts residential vacancy.

📦 4. Sectoral Sensitivity & Linkage Features
🧩 4.1 Wage–Retail Coupling
Coupling

)
Coupling=Correlation(Wages,RetailSales,rolling window=4)
Why: High coupling = income translates quickly to consumption → low retail vacancy.

🧩 4.2 Wage × Service Employment
Feature: Avg Hourly Earning * Employment in Services
Why: Service-heavy regions turn wages into demand quickly (important for retail and office sectors).

🧩 4.3 Wage–Technology Intensity Index
Tech Intensity
=
Wage Growth in Tech Industries
/
Total Wage Growth
Tech Intensity=Wage Growth in Tech Industries/Total Wage Growth
Why: Captures presence of innovation-driven job markets — crucial for office space forecasting.

⚙️ 5. Labor–Cost Pressure Features (Supply-Side)
🧩 5.1 Wage Cost Index for Developers
WageCostIndex
=
ConstructionWageGrowth
Avg Hourly Earnings
WageCostIndex= 
Avg Hourly Earnings
ConstructionWageGrowth
​
 
Why: High labor cost → higher construction costs → limited new supply → ↓ future vacancy.

🧩 5.2 Wage–Material Cost Divergence
Divergence
=
Wage Growth
−
ConstructionMaterialCost Growth
Divergence=Wage Growth−ConstructionMaterialCost Growth
Why: If wages rise slower than material cost, construction margins shrink → reduced new projects → ↓ vacancy risk later.

🧩 5.3 Employment Cost Index Spread
Spread
=
Avg Hourly Earnings Growth
−
EmploymentCostIndex Growth
Spread=Avg Hourly Earnings Growth−EmploymentCostIndex Growth
Why: Measures gap between private wages and overall labor costs (signals business strain).

🌍 6. Spatial Economic Mobility Features
🧩 6.1 Wage Attraction Index
Attraction
=
(Market Wage – National Average)
×
Net Migration
Attraction=(Market Wage – National Average)×Net Migration
Why: High-wage markets with net inflow = strong population magnet → lower vacancy.

🧩 6.2 Wage Gradient Momentum
Compute slope of local wage difference vs distance to major city (e.g., distance from NYC).
Why: Captures suburban spillover effects — rising wages spreading out → regional vacancy tightening.

🧩 6.3 Wage–Commuter Affordability Index
Index
=
Avg Hourly Earnings in Suburb
Transport Cost to City
Index= 
Transport Cost to City
Avg Hourly Earnings in Suburb
​
 
Why: When suburban wage power > commute cost → migration to suburbs → rising suburban demand.
