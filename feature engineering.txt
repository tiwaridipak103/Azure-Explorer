We are working on Moody's dataset with multiple features and responses for each market.It is quarterly data that means, that every quarter, new record come for each market .It is real estate dataset.
I am currently working with feature name Industrial_Production_Index and response vacancy_rate. Help me understand how it works
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — let’s unpack this carefully.

You’re working on Moody’s real estate dataset (quarterly, multi-market), analyzing how the Industrial Production Index (IPI) might influence or explain vacancy rates across property types and regions.

Let’s go step by step so you deeply understand both the economic mechanism and its data implications 👇

🔹 1. What the Industrial Production Index (IPI) Measures
The Industrial Production Index tracks the output of factories, mines, and utilities.
It’s an indicator of manufacturing and industrial activity — essentially, how much goods are being produced within a country or region.

Rising IPI → indicates strong industrial and manufacturing growth.

Falling IPI → indicates industrial slowdown, reduced demand, or recessionary trends.

It’s often used to measure economic momentum, especially in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, energy, and infrastructure.

🔹 2. Economic Link to Real Estate and Vacancy Rate
Let’s think about how industrial activity links to real estate occupancy (and hence vacancy rates):

Real Estate Type	Expected Relationship with IPI	Explanation
🏭 Industrial / Warehouses	Negative (higher IPI → lower vacancy)	When industrial production grows, factories, warehouses, and logistics hubs expand → higher demand → less vacancy.
🏢 Office	Mixed	Higher production can lead to more business activity → more office space demand. But manufacturing-heavy growth may not directly translate to office occupancy.
🛍️ Retail	Positive (indirect)	Industrial growth raises employment/income → higher consumer spending → retail expansion → lower retail vacancy.
🏘️ Apartments / Housing	Lagged Negative	When production grows, employment improves → more people can afford rent/buy → lower vacancy. However, this effect appears with a lag (1–2 quarters).
So typically:

An increase in IPI → stronger economy → lower vacancy rates, especially in industrial and retail property types.

🔹 3. Time Dynamics (Quarterly Nature)
Because your data is quarterly, you can capture the lagged effects:

IPI_t-1 or IPI_t-2: Industrial output this quarter often affects vacancy in the next quarter or two, not instantly.

Reason: Companies don’t lease new space immediately after higher production; they plan expansions gradually.

✅ Feature Engineering Tip:
Include lagged features like:

Industrial_Production_Index_lag1

Industrial_Production_Index_lag2

QoQ_change_in_IPI = (IPI_t - IPI_t-1) / IPI_t-1

YoY_change_in_IPI = (IPI_t - IPI_t-4) / IPI_t-4

🔹 4. Interpretation Example
Say you’re analyzing Austin Industrial Vacancy Rate:

In Q1 2023, IPI grew +3% QoQ.

In Q2 2023, vacancy dropped from 10% → 8%.
👉 Suggests industrial growth boosted warehouse demand.

You can statistically test this using correlation or regression:

🔹 5. Out-of-the-Box Feature Engineering (Advanced)
Here are high-end features used by top real estate analytics teams:

Feature	Description	Why It’s Useful
IPI Growth Volatility (rolling std)	4-quarter rolling standard deviation of IPI growth	Measures industrial uncertainty — higher volatility can increase vacancy due to hesitation in expansion.
Cumulative IPI Growth (last 4 quarters)	Sum of growth rates over the last year	Captures momentum effect; sustained growth may strongly reduce vacancy.
Deviation from Long-term Trend	IPI - rolling mean(8 quarters)	Detects overheating or downturns relative to trend.
Interaction Term: IPI × Business_Confidence_Index	Multiply IPI with business sentiment	Captures confidence-adjusted industrial strength.
Regional Relative IPI	Market IPI / National IPI	Measures whether a region is outperforming or lagging the national trend. Regions outperforming → lower vacancy.
🔹 6. Practical Insights
In industrial-heavy markets (e.g., Houston, Dallas), IPI will have strong direct impact.

In service-driven markets (e.g., New York, San Francisco), it may have weaker or lagged effect.

If vacancy doesn’t respond much to IPI changes, consider interacting it with manufacturing employment or transportation index — these refine the connection.

🔹 7. Summary
Concept	Effect
Rising IPI	Lower vacancy (esp. industrial & retail)
Falling IPI	Higher vacancy (less production → layoffs → less space demand)
Lagged effects	Typically 1–2 quarters
Best features	Lagged IPI, growth rates, volatility, relative IPI, interaction with sentiment/employment
Would you like me to now show you “top-notch feature engineering formulas” (like what top real estate research firms or Moody’s Analytics labs might compute) specifically for the Industrial_Production_Index column — similar to what we did for your other features?

Perfect 👌 — let’s build out-of-the-box, industry-level feature engineering ideas for
📊 Industrial_Production_Index (IPI) that are actually used by top-tier real estate analytics teams (like Moody’s, CBRE, JLL, or CoStar Research) to model things like vacancy_rate.

We’ll organize them from basic → advanced → creative cross-domain so you can plug them into your modeling workflow directly.

🧩 1. Core Transformations (Standard but Powerful)
These make IPI directly comparable across time and markets.

Feature Name	Formula	Interpretation
IPI_QoQ_Growth	(IPI_t - IPI_t-1) / IPI_t-1	Quarterly industrial growth — immediate demand signal
IPI_YoY_Growth	(IPI_t - IPI_t-4) / IPI_t-4	Year-over-year expansion — long-term health
IPI_Lag1, IPI_Lag2	Shift IPI by 1–2 quarters	Captures lagged demand impact on real estate
IPI_Momentum_4Q	Mean of last 4 QoQ growths	Rolling growth strength (momentum)
IPI_Deceleration	IPI_QoQ_Growth - IPI_QoQ_Growth_lag1	Identifies slowdown phases
⚙️ 2. Trend & Volatility Features (Advanced Economic Signals)
These help models capture cycles, turning points, and uncertainty — very important for vacancy forecasting.

Feature Name	Formula	Meaning
IPI_Trend_8Q	Rolling mean (8-quarter window)	Long-term trajectory of industrial growth
IPI_Volatility_4Q	Rolling std of QoQ growth (4 quarters)	Measures production instability → higher vacancy risk
IPI_ZScore	(IPI_t - mean(IPI_last_8Q)) / std(IPI_last_8Q)	Detects abnormal surges or drops
IPI_Trend_Deviation	IPI_t - IPI_Trend_8Q	Deviation from long-term average; cyclical highs/lows
IPI_Recession_Flag	1 if IPI_QoQ_Growth < -0.02 for 2+ consecutive quarters	Flags contraction phases
🧠 3. Relative & Interaction Features (Cross-Market Insights)
These highlight how a market’s industrial performance compares to the nation or peers.

Feature Name	Formula	Why It Matters
Regional_IPI_to_National_IPI	Market_IPI / National_IPI	Measures local outperform/underperform — leading markets have lower vacancies
Relative_IPI_Growth	(Market_IPI_Growth - National_IPI_Growth)	Competitive edge measure
IPI_x_Employment	IPI_Growth * Manufacturing_Employment_Growth	Strong joint signal of capacity expansion
IPI_x_Business_Confidence	IPI_Growth * Business_Sentiment_Index	Captures whether growth is optimistic or fragile
IPI_x_Transport_Index	IPI_Growth * Freight_Transportation_Index	Industrial demand supported by logistics strength
🚀 4. Cycle-Aware / Structural Features (Used by Moody’s Research Teams)
Real estate cycles lag industrial cycles — these features track that relationship.

Feature	Description	Insight
IPI_Lead_Lag_Correlation	Correlation between IPI_(t-k) and Vacancy_t (for k=1..4)	Identifies optimal lag between industrial shifts and real estate response
IPI_Rolling_MinMax_Spread	(max - min) of IPI in last 4–8 quarters	Measures amplitude of industrial swings
IPI_Phase	Categorical: {Expansion, Peak, Contraction, Recovery} (based on growth sign changes)	Enables cycle-stage models (very useful for time-aware ML models)
IPI_Peak_to_Trough	Difference between last max and current level	Quantifies how deep the industrial slump is
Cumulative_IPI_Change_Year	Sum of QoQ changes across the last 4 quarters	Captures sustained growth momentum
🧮 5. Normalization & Detrending (For Modeling Stability)
Because IPI often rises long-term due to inflation and population growth:

Feature	Technique	Benefit
IPI_Detrended	Residual from regression of IPI on time	Removes long-term drift, isolates cyclical signal
IPI_Index_to_BaseYear	IPI_t / IPI_2015Q1 - 1	Anchors to a base year (helps across regions)
IPI_Per_Capita	IPI / Population	Controls for population size — truer productivity signal
🧬 6. Cross-Sector Fusion Features (Cutting-Edge)
Top real estate quant teams often fuse IPI with complementary macro indicators.

Feature	Definition	Why It’s Cutting-Edge
Industrial_Demand_Pressure_Index	(IPI_Growth + Freight_Index_Growth + Manufacturing_Employment_Growth)/3	Synthetic index predicting industrial absorption pressure
IPI_to_Retail_Sales_Ratio	IPI / Total_Retail_Sales	Balance between production & consumption — influences mixed-use demand
IPI_Diff_from_Energy_Production	IPI_Growth - Energy_Index_Growth	Industrial demand relative to energy supply — can flag cost-push risks
IPI_Shock_Indicator	1 if	ΔIPI_QoQ
💡 7. Visual Diagnostic Features (For Causal Validation)
Before modeling, you can:

Plot cross-correlation between IPI and vacancy_rate at multiple lags → visually check relationship.

Use Granger causality tests to verify if IPI helps predict vacancy_rate.

Build interaction surfaces between IPI_Growth and property type (office, industrial, retail) — to show sensitivity differences.

✅ 8. Example Code Snippet (Python / pandas)
df = df.sort_values(['market', 'quarter'])
df['IPI_QoQ_Growth'] = df.groupby('market')['Industrial_Production_Index'].pct_change(1)
df['IPI_YoY_Growth'] = df.groupby('market')['Industrial_Production_Index'].pct_change(4)
df['IPI_Lag1'] = df.groupby('market')['Industrial_Production_Index'].shift(1)
df['IPI_Trend_8Q'] = df.groupby('market')['Industrial_Production_Index'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(8).mean())
df['IPI_Deviation'] = df['Industrial_Production_Index'] - df['IPI_Trend_8Q']
df['IPI_Volatility_4Q'] = df.groupby('market')['IPI_QoQ_Growth'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(4).std())
df['IPI_Phase'] = np.where(df['IPI_QoQ_Growth']>0, 'Expansion','Contraction')
Would you like me to now shortlist the Top 10 most predictive IPI-derived features (the ones that real estate econometric models and ML pipelines find most influential on vacancy rates)?
That list is ideal if you want to prioritize which ones to actually include in modeling.

Sorry I was asking can you look for some more top notch features engineering which top real estate industry use
ChatGPT said:
Cool, let’s dig into really strong, less-common / high-signal feature engineering approaches that are used in the real estate / CRE research world (beyond the basics). These tend to give you the edge. I’ll focus on what top firms and academic papers use, especially in modeling vacancy, absorption, rents, etc., and then how to adapt them to your Industrial_Production_Index feature.

🔍 1. What I found from real estate research
Here are some methods / feature-engineering themes taken from recent research that appear to deliver strong predictive value:

Spatial / Geographical Features & Weighting
Papers use geographically weighted regression, spatial lag features, distance to transportation, clustering of markets, etc. They enhance models by including how close or competitive neighboring markets are. 
SpringerLink
+2
MDPI
+2

Multi-source Data Fusion
Using not just economic indices and real estate data, but adding census, demographic, mobility, remote sensing (e.g. nighttime light), transport accessibility. These capture latent demand / availability pressures. 
MDPI
+2
MDPI
+2

Cycle / Regime / Phase Indicators
Identifying whether the economy / market is in expansion, contraction, recovery, or peak phase. These can be deduced from macro indicators (industrial production, employment, GDP growth). Useful because vacancy does not react uniformly across cycles. 
MDPI
+1

Shock / Event Features
Sudden drops/spikes in macro indicators (production, manufacturing output), policy changes, large supply additions (new inventory), etc. These “shock features” often correlate with vacancy upticks. Researchers try to capture shocks by looking at exceeding thresholds or deviations from trend. 
MDPI

Demographic / Socioeconomic Interactions
Income, population growth (or decline), migration, age structure. These features interact with economic production indices: e.g., high industrial production but declining population may have less vacancy drop than expected. 
MDPI
+1

Temporal / Lagged Features
Many papers show that the effect of macro activity on vacancy / rents occurs with significant lags (1–4 quarters). Some use distributed lag models, or rolling sums / averages. 
MDPI

Comparative / Peer / Benchmark Features
How one market is performing relative to its peers, or to a national average, or to trend. That helps normalize for broader macro conditions.

🚀 2. More “top notch” / cutting-edge features you can build for IPI
Using those themes, here are some sophisticated / lesser-used feature ideas built around Industrial_Production_Index that top real estate / CRE / econometric modeling groups would try. Many of these go beyond what most people do, and require some more data or computation — but they tend to pay off.

Feature	Why It’s High Signal / Where It Helps	How You Compute It
IPI Turning Point Flags	Vacancies shift when production stops accelerating. Identifying peaks, dips, or inflection points helps anticipate reversals in vacancy trends.	Use second derivative / acceleration: compute growth in IPI, then growth of growth. If QoQ growth goes from positive → negative (or vice versa) above a threshold, flag as “IPI_peak” or “IPI_trough”.
IPI Distributed Lag Features	Demand effects take time to materialize. Some quarters, IPI rise might show up in vacancy 2–3 quarters later.	Create lagged versions for lags 1,2,3,4; maybe an exponentially decayed sum of past IPI growths: e.g., sum_{k=1 to 4} (IPI_growth_{t-k} * weight_k), weight decreasing for older lags.
IPI Shock / Outlier Measures	Big unexpected changes—spikes or drops—often trigger visible vacancy changes.	Compute residuals from a smoothed trend (e.g. moving average or ARIMA trend), then find when residual / trend > threshold (e.g. ±2 standard deviations). Create binary flags.
IPI Volatility / Uncertainty Measures	High volatility in industrial production could create risk aversion by tenants or developers, slowing leasing / new construction, which might raise vacancy.	Rolling standard deviation of IPI growth over various windows (4, 8 quarters), perhaps also the coefficient of variation (std / mean).
IPI Momentum & Mean Reversion Features	Strong continued growth often leads to falling vacancy, but after peaks there can be overshoot or reversion.	Compute cumulative growth over past N quarters (e.g. 4, 8), and compute how far current IPI is above/below its rolling trend (trend from past 8 quarters). Also, ratio of recent growth vs long-run growth.
Relative / Peer Market IPI Gaps	If your market's IPI growth lags national or regional IPI growth, vacancy might not fall as much. If it leads, might predict future vacancy improvement.	For each market, compute market_IPI_growth − national_IPI_growth; also compute market_IPI / national_IPI; maybe percentile rank of markets by IPI growth.
Supply-Side / Inventory Interaction Features	Vacancy is impacted not just by demand (as proxied by IPI), but also by how much new inventory is coming to market. Including supply changes can moderate the effect of IPI.	If you have data on square feet added (or delivered inventory), compute “IPI × supply_growth” or “IPI minus net supply growth”. Another: “demand_pressure” = (IPI growth) / (inventory growth + small constant).
Cost / Input-Side Features	Changes in input costs (labor, materials, energy) can affect industrial output and capacity, hence affect how vacancy reacts. If industrial growth is high but costs are rising fast, maybe vacancy response is muted.	Include features like energy price index, raw materials price index, wage inflation in manufacturing. Then interactions: IPI_growth × (1 / cost_inflation) or difference.
Industry Composition / Sectoral IPI	Not all industrial production is equal: heavy vs light industry, durable vs non-durable goods. Those sub‐sectors might correlate differently with real estate demand (warehouses, logistics vs factories).	If you have sectoral breakdowns, compute growth by sub‐sector; compute contribution shares; maybe a feature “weight of durable goods in IPI” or “light_industry_share_growth”.
Policy / Regulatory / Financing Conditions	Interest rates, credit availability, trade policy shocks can amplify or damp industrial production’s effect. Some CRE lenders include financing cost or policy‐shock features.	Collect data on interest rates, manufacturing investment incentives, trade tariffs. Then features like IPI_growth × (1 − interest_rate) or binary flags (e.g. “policy_change_quarter”).
Forward Looking / Leading Indicators	Sometimes you can combine IPI with other leading indicators (e.g. Purchasing Managers’ Index, new orders, freight tonnage) to build early warning features.	Use leading indicator series, then create features like Lead_Index_growth and maybe combined with IPI: IPI_lead_index_ratio. Also, leading indicator lags: LeadIndex_t-1, etc.
Interaction with Demand‐Side Macros	Industrial output may affect vacancy less when demand (population, employment, income growth) is weak. So interactions help capture that nuance.	Features like IPI_growth × employment_growth, IPI_growth × population_growth, IPI_growth × consumer_income_growth.
⚙️ 3. Implementation Tips and Prioritization
Because you can’t just create every possible fancy feature (because of overfitting, dimensionality, collinearity etc.), here are guidelines:

Start with a few high payoff ones

Lagged IPI (1–2 quarters)

Relative IPI to national/regional benchmark

IPI shock flag (significant deviation from trend)

Validate with domain‐specific knowledge

How long do industrial demand cycles work in your markets?

What is the lag between production and announcement of space expansion / leasing?

Use regularization or feature selection

Lasso, Ridge, or tree‐based model’s feature importance to prune features.

Cross‐validation to check whether features generalize out of sample.

Ensure data quality and consistency

If IPI is revised later, ensure you account for revisions.

Ensure you compute trend / moving average on sufficient history.

Be careful of multicollinearity

Many of these features will be correlated. Use PCA or clustering or drop redundant ones.

Sometimes combining features instead of including many similar ones helps.

If you like, I can generate a set of ~10 “premium” IPI features (with formulas) tailored for your dataset (quarterly, multiple markets) — you can pick which ones to build. Do you want me to do that?

So me some more features engineering with Industrial_Production_Index.
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — let’s go deeper 💡

You already have a solid foundation with growth rates, lags, and trend deviations. Now, I’ll show you additional “top-tier” feature engineering ideas with the Industrial_Production_Index (IPI) that major real estate analytics teams (like Moody’s, CBRE Econometric Advisors, JLL, and Oxford Economics) often apply.

These are the more advanced, creative, and research-grade ones used to extract maximum signal from macro indicators when predicting vacancy rates, absorption, or rent growth.

🧭 1. Cyclical and Structural Features
Capture where the economy is in the cycle — top CRE models love these.

Feature Name	Formula / Idea	Why It’s Valuable
IPI_Cycle_Phase	Categorize into Expansion, Peak, Contraction, Recovery using IPI QoQ growth signs and changes	Vacancy often rises in contraction and peaks in recovery; this categorical variable captures non-linear effects.
IPI_Cycle_Intensity	abs(Δ IPI_QoQ_Growth)	Magnitude of acceleration or deceleration — shows how violently production is changing.
IPI_Gap_to_Peak	IPI_t - max(IPI_last_12Q)	Measures how far the current index is below the last high — indicates recession depth.
IPI_Gap_to_Trough	IPI_t - min(IPI_last_12Q)	Measures recovery strength after a downturn.
IPI_Cumulative_Slope	Slope of linear regression of IPI over past 8 quarters	Captures underlying industrial trend independent of noise.
⚙️ 2. Derived Macro Pressure Features
Real estate markets react to industrial capacity utilization and overheating signals.

Feature Name	Formula / Idea	Why It’s Valuable
IPI_Capacity_Utilization_Proxy	IPI / long_term_max(IPI)	Approximates how close the economy is to full industrial capacity → leads to tighter space markets.
IPI_Demand_Pressure	(IPI_Growth - Construction_Output_Growth)	If production rises faster than supply expansion, demand pressure builds → lower vacancy.
IPI_Output_to_Wages_Ratio	IPI / Manufacturing_Wage_Index	Measures efficiency — rising output with controlled costs implies industrial health.
IPI_to_Import_Ratio	IPI / Imports_Index	Higher ratio → more domestic production → more local industrial space demand.
🧮 3. Rolling Behavior and Momentum
These detect persistence, volatility, and predictability in industrial output — vital for leading vacancy trends.

Feature Name	Formula	Intuition
IPI_Momentum_Score	(IPI_t - IPI_t-4) / (IPI_t-8 - IPI_t-12)	Measures whether growth is speeding up or slowing down compared to last year.
IPI_4Q_Moving_Average	Rolling mean of 4Q IPI	Smooths short-term shocks to reveal sustained trend.
IPI_Rolling_Skewness_8Q	Skewness of IPI growth over 8 quarters	Detects asymmetric expansion vs contraction tendencies.
IPI_Volatility_Index	(rolling_std(ΔIPI, 4Q)) / rolling_mean(IPI, 4Q)	Relative volatility — more uncertainty often drives higher vacancy.
IPI_Momentum_Indicator	1 if last 3 IPI_QoQ_Growth values are positive, else 0	Simplified binary trend continuation flag.
🔗 4. Inter-Market and Relative Strength Features
Used by Moody’s, CBRE, and REIS when analyzing regional disparities.

Feature	Formula / Concept	Why It Helps
IPI_Market_vs_National	(Market_IPI / National_IPI) - 1	Markets outperforming the national trend generally see faster occupancy improvement.
IPI_Peer_Performance_Spread	Market_IPI_Growth - Average_IPI_Growth_of_Peer_Markets	Shows local competitive edge or weakness.
IPI_Spatial_Spillover	Weighted average IPI of nearby markets (based on distance or economic ties)	Captures industrial spillover from neighboring regions.
IPI_Regional_Cluster_Average	Mean IPI of similar-market cluster	Identifies cross-market industrial synchrony, useful for explaining correlated vacancy shifts.
🔬 5. Shock & Resilience Metrics
Top firms explicitly model how markets react to industrial shocks.

Feature	Formula / Method	Interpretation
IPI_Shock_Indicator	1 if	ΔIPI_QoQ
IPI_Rebound_Speed	(IPI_t - IPI_min_since_last_peak) / (# of quarters since trough)	Speed of recovery from downturn — strong predictor of future occupancy rebound.
IPI_Shock_Recovery_Lag	Time between IPI trough and return to previous level	Markets that recover faster see early improvement in vacancy.
IPI_Resilience_Index	1 / (drop_duration × drop_magnitude)	Quantifies how resistant industrial activity is to declines.
🧠 6. Interaction-Based High-Order Features
These combine IPI with other economic / property indicators to explain multi-factor dynamics.

Feature	Formula	Rationale
IPI × Employment_Growth	IPI_QoQ_Growth * Employment_Growth	Measures demand-supported industrial expansion.
IPI × Energy_Consumption	IPI_Growth * Energy_Index	High correlation to manufacturing and warehouse absorption.
IPI × Vacancy_Lag	IPI_Growth_t-1 * Vacancy_Rate_t-1	Captures whether strong industrial growth can offset previous vacancy spikes.
IPI × Construction_Spending	IPI_QoQ_Growth * Construction_Activity_Index	Balances demand vs new supply creation.
IPI × Logistics_Index	IPI_Growth * Freight_Transportation_Index	Indicates integrated industrial–logistics strength — often predictive for industrial and retail vacancy.
🔢 7. Temporal-Pattern / Machine-Learning-Friendly Features
Modern CRE models sometimes encode IPI temporal shape using statistics or embeddings.

Feature	Concept	Benefit
IPI_Fourier_Seasonality_Features	Apply Fourier transform to IPI to capture cyclical frequency components	Extracts hidden cycles influencing vacancy.
IPI_PCA_Component	Use PCA across macro variables (IPI, GDP, employment, retail sales) to derive main economic component	Reduces redundancy and captures macro cycle as a single “economic driver.”
IPI_Trend_Slope_Encoded	Fit a small regression window (e.g., 6–8 quarters) and store slope as feature	Stable representation for ML models.
IPI_LSTM_Embedding (optional)	Train small time-series autoencoder to summarize industrial dynamics	Used by research teams for high-frequency predictive modeling.
🏁 8. Practical Real Estate Applications
Different property types respond differently:

Industrial: IPI rise → immediate drop in vacancy.

Retail: Lagged response (~1–2 quarters).

Office: Depends on secondary manufacturing employment.

Apartments: Weak but lagged correlation via job creation.

Thus, you might also create property-type interaction features:

IPI_Industrial = IPI_Growth * (Property_Type == 'Industrial')
IPI_Retail = IPI_Growth * (Property_Type == 'Retail')
IPI_Office = IPI_Growth * (Property_Type == 'Office')
This helps your model capture differential sensitivity across asset classes.

⚡ 9. Top 10 “Elite” IPI Features (Summary)
If you want a shortlist that high-end CRE forecasting teams deploy:

IPI_QoQ_Growth

IPI_YoY_Growth

IPI_Lag1, IPI_Lag2

IPI_Trend_Deviation (vs 8-quarter mean)

IPI_Volatility_4Q

IPI_Cycle_Phase

IPI_Shock_Indicator

Regional_IPI_to_National_IPI

IPI × Employment_Growth
