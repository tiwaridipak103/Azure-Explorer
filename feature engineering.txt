Subject: Apology for Missing the “Engaging in Conversation” Session on 11th Nov

Hi <Manager’s Name>,

I sincerely apologize for not being able to attend the “Engaging in Conversation” session scheduled on 11th November.

I had enrolled with full intention to attend, but on the same day I got unexpectedly occupied due to an urgent land-related dispute with my neighbour. I was under the impression that the matter would be resolved earlier, and even if it extended, 11th November might be a holiday in Bihar due to the elections, which would have allowed me to join the session. Unfortunately, the situation escalated unexpectedly and required my immediate presence throughout the day.

I completely understand the importance of the session and my responsibility to manage such commitments properly. Missing it was never my intention, and I take full accountability for not informing you in advance when I realised I might not be able to join.

I genuinely value your trust and guidance, and I assure you this will not be repeated. If there is an option to attend a repeat session or complete any alternative learning to make up for this, I am fully willing to do so.

Once again, I am really sorry for the inconvenience caused.

Regards,
Dipak

If you want, I can also make the tone more formal, more apologetic, or more confident.
