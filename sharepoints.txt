You said:
Can we update and delete postgresql database like inserting ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can update and delete records in a PostgreSQL database just like you can insert records. The SQL syntax for updating and deleting records is straightforward. Here's how you can perform these operations:

1. Inserting Data
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
2. Updating Data
To update existing records in a PostgreSQL table, use the UPDATE statement:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
table_name: The table where you want to update data.
SET: Specifies the columns and new values you want to assign.
WHERE: Filters which rows to update. If you don’t include a WHERE clause, all rows will be updated.
Example:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 70000
WHERE employee_id = 5;
3. Deleting Data
To delete records, use the DELETE statement:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
table_name: The table from which you want to delete data.
WHERE: Specifies which records to delete. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted.
Example:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 5;
Key Considerations:
Transactions: Use transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK) to ensure data consistency, especially if you're making multiple updates or deletes.
Indexes: Make sure your WHERE conditions use indexed columns for faster updates and deletes.

You said:
No ,When i give instruction about detail of dags , airflow dag processor passe this info to airflow database for registration , 
similiarly , are there any ways to update or delete 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, in Apache Airflow, DAGs are registered with the Airflow metadata database when they are processed by the DAG processor. This database stores information about DAGs, tasks, and other Airflow components. However, updating or deleting a DAG from the metadata database does not work the same way as inserting. Let's break it down:

1. DAG Registration in the Metadata Database
When you define a new DAG in Python and place it in the DAGs folder, the scheduler parses the file and registers the DAG in the Airflow metadata database.

2. How to Update a DAG
To update a DAG, you typically modify the Python file defining the DAG (e.g., updating tasks, schedules, or dependencies). Once this file is updated, Airflow automatically:

Detects the changes during the next scheduling interval or when you manually trigger a refresh.
Updates the DAG in the metadata database with the new configuration.
Process:

Modify the DAG file: Edit your .py DAG file.
Save the changes: The scheduler will pick up the changes and reprocess the DAG.
Restart scheduler (optional): In some cases, restarting the scheduler ensures changes are fully registered.
3. Deleting a DAG
Deleting a DAG involves a bit more work because simply deleting the Python file from the DAGs folder does not remove the DAG's historical metadata from the database.

Steps to Delete a DAG:
Delete the DAG file:

Remove or rename the DAG file from the DAGs directory.
Clear DAG metadata from the UI or CLI:

From the Airflow UI: Go to the DAGs tab, find the DAG you want to delete, and select "Delete". This will clear the DAG from the interface, but the history remains.
From the CLI:
bash
Copy code
airflow dags delete <dag_id>
This will delete all records of the DAG from the metadata database.
Manually delete DAG history from the database (optional):

If you want to remove all traces of the DAG from the metadata database (including history and logs), you need to manually delete the records from the PostgreSQL database.
Example queries to delete from the PostgreSQL database:

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM dag WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';
DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';
DELETE FROM task_instance WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';
Be careful with these queries, as they will delete historical data related to the DAG.

4. Updating DAG Metadata in the Database
Directly updating DAG metadata in the PostgreSQL database is not recommended. Instead, updating the Python DAG definition and letting the scheduler handle the rest is the correct approach.

5. Cleaning Up Old DAGs
If you have a lot of outdated DAGs in the database, you can use Airflow’s database cleanup mechanisms. There are tools and scripts available that can clean up the metadata for old DAG runs, task instances, and logs to keep the database lightweight.

Conclusion
To update a DAG: Modify the Python file and the scheduler will take care of updating the metadata.
To delete a DAG: Remove the Python file, and delete the DAG from the Airflow UI/CLI, and optionally clean up the database if needed.
Let me know if you need help with any of these processes!

how to perform update and delete operation from airflow.py file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In Apache Airflow, the airflow.py file (which is typically your DAG definition file) is primarily used to define workflows (DAGs) and tasks. However, updating or deleting entries in the PostgreSQL metadata database through the Airflow code itself is not the typical workflow for managing DAGs. Airflow automatically updates DAG information whenever you modify a DAG file, but if you need to perform explicit update or delete operations on the metadata database from within a DAG, you can do so by using Python's database connection capabilities.

Here's how you can update or delete entries in the Airflow PostgreSQL metadata database from your airflow.py file using the PythonOperator or BashOperator.

Steps for Update/Delete Operations via Python
Install PostgreSQL Connector First, ensure that the PostgreSQL connector (psycopg2) is installed in your Airflow environment.

You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install psycopg2
Use PythonOperator to Perform Update/Delete In your airflow.py file, you can use the PythonOperator to run custom Python code that connects to the PostgreSQL database and executes the SQL UPDATE or DELETE queries.

Here’s a sample workflow:

Example: Update and Delete Operations in airflow.py
python
Copy code
import psycopg2
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define DAG
dag = DAG('update_delete_dag', start_date=datetime(2024, 9, 17), schedule_interval='@once')

# PostgreSQL connection settings
def get_postgres_connection():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        host="localhost",  # Replace with your DB host
        database="airflow_db",  # Replace with your DB name
        user="your_username",  # Replace with your DB username
        password="your_password"  # Replace with your DB password
    )
    return conn

# Function to perform an UPDATE operation in the database
def update_dag_status(**context):
    conn = get_postgres_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Example: Update dag status
    update_query = "UPDATE dag SET is_active = false WHERE dag_id = %s"
    cursor.execute(update_query, ('your_dag_id',))  # Replace 'your_dag_id' with the actual DAG ID
    
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print(f"DAG status updated for dag_id: your_dag_id")

# Function to perform a DELETE operation in the database
def delete_dag_run(**context):
    conn = get_postgres_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Example: Delete specific dag runs
    delete_query = "DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = %s AND execution_date < %s"
    cursor.execute(delete_query, ('your_dag_id', '2024-09-01'))  # Replace with actual values
    
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Deleted old DAG runs for dag_id: your_dag_id")

# Define tasks
update_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='update_dag_status',
    python_callable=update_dag_status,
    dag=dag
)

delete_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='delete_old_dag_run',
    python_callable=delete_dag_run,
    dag=dag
)

# Set task dependencies
update_task >> delete_task
Explanation:
PostgreSQL Connection: We define a helper function get_postgres_connection() to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Make sure to replace the credentials with your actual PostgreSQL connection details.

Update Operation: The update_dag_status function contains an SQL UPDATE query that marks a DAG as inactive in the dag table.

Delete Operation: The delete_dag_run function executes an SQL DELETE query to remove old dag_run entries for a particular DAG ID before a specified execution date.

PythonOperator: We use PythonOperator to call these Python functions inside Airflow.

DAG Execution: The DAG is set to run once (schedule_interval='@once'), but you can adjust it based on your needs.

Running Bash Commands to Update/Delete
Alternatively, you could use the BashOperator to directly run SQL commands from within a shell script or the psql command-line tool.

Here’s an example using BashOperator:

python
Copy code
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime

dag = DAG('bash_update_delete_dag', start_date=datetime(2024, 9, 17), schedule_interval='@once')

update_command = """
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d airflow_db -c "UPDATE dag SET is_active = false WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';"
"""

delete_command = """
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d airflow_db -c "DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id' AND execution_date < '2024-09-01';"
"""

# Define BashOperator tasks
update_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='bash_update_dag_status',
    bash_command=update_command,
    dag=dag
)

delete_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='bash_delete_old_dag_run',
    bash_command=delete_command,
    dag=dag
)

# Set task dependencies
update_task >> delete_task
Key Points:
Security: Ensure you don’t expose sensitive credentials like database passwords. You can use Airflow’s connection manager to securely store your credentials and access them using environment variables or Airflow hooks.

Transactions: Both update and delete operations should be performed in transactions. The example above ensures the operations are committed with conn.commit().

Testing: Test these operations in a non-production environment first to ensure they behave as expected without affecting live data.

Conclusion:
You can perform update and delete operations on the Airflow metadata database from the airflow.py file using either PythonOperator or BashOperator with custom SQL queries. This allows for dynamic control over the metadata, enabling you to manipulate the DAG entries directly from within your DAG code.






You said:
is it possiblw without creating dags
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, it's possible to update or delete records in the Airflow metadata database (such as PostgreSQL) without creating a DAG. You can do this by directly interacting with the PostgreSQL database via SQL queries, either through a database client, a Python script, or by using a CLI tool like psql.

Here are a few ways you can achieve this:

1. Using the psql Command-Line Tool
You can run SQL queries directly on the PostgreSQL database using the psql command-line tool, which allows you to execute UPDATE and DELETE commands without involving Airflow DAGs.

Example to Update a DAG:
bash
Copy code
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d airflow_db -c "UPDATE dag SET is_active = false WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';"
Example to Delete a DAG:
bash
Copy code
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d airflow_db -c "DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';"
2. Using a Python Script (Without Airflow)
You can create a simple Python script to interact with the PostgreSQL database, perform update and delete operations, and manage the DAG metadata. You can run this script independently from Airflow.

Example Python Script:
python
Copy code
import psycopg2

# PostgreSQL connection settings
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",  # Replace with your DB host
    database="airflow_db",  # Replace with your DB name
    user="your_username",  # Replace with your DB username
    password="your_password"  # Replace with your DB password
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Update DAG status
update_query = "UPDATE dag SET is_active = false WHERE dag_id = %s"
cursor.execute(update_query, ('your_dag_id',))  # Replace 'your_dag_id' with actual DAG ID

# Delete DAG runs
delete_query = "DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = %s AND execution_date < %s"
cursor.execute(delete_query, ('your_dag_id', '2024-09-01'))  # Replace with actual values

conn.commit()

cursor.close()
conn.close()

print("Update and delete operations completed successfully.")
You can run this Python script manually or schedule it with a cron job if needed.

3. Using a SQL Client
If you're more comfortable with a graphical user interface (GUI), you can use a PostgreSQL SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, or any other SQL client) to connect to the Airflow metadata database and run SQL queries to update or delete records.

Example in pgAdmin:
Open pgAdmin or your preferred SQL client.
Connect to your Airflow PostgreSQL database.
Run your UPDATE or DELETE queries in the query editor:
Update:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE dag SET is_active = false WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id';
Delete:
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM dag_run WHERE dag_id = 'your_dag_id' AND execution_date < '2024-09-01';
4. Using Airflow's CLI (without DAGs)
You can use the Airflow CLI to manage some aspects of DAGs without creating new DAGs. While you can't directly run SQL queries, you can use CLI commands to deactivate or delete DAGs.

Example CLI Commands:
Deactivate a DAG:
bash
Copy code
airflow dags pause your_dag_id
Delete a DAG from the metadata:
bash
Copy code
airflow dags delete your_dag_id
These commands won’t require you to modify or create new DAGs, and they let you manage DAGs through Airflow’s interface.

Conclusion:
You can interact with the Airflow metadata database directly using PostgreSQL tools, Python scripts, or the Airflow CLI without needing to create new DAGs. This gives you flexibility to update or delete records in the Airflow database when necessary, independently of the DAG system.






You said:
are there any airflow function available to do update and delete operation
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Apache Airflow doesn't natively provide specific functions or APIs to directly perform UPDATE or DELETE operations on its metadata database (PostgreSQL or any other database). The Airflow metadata database is meant to store information about DAGs, task instances, logs, and other internal components, and typically, this data is managed automatically by Airflow. However, you can use some of the Airflow functions or CLI commands to indirectly perform operations similar to update and delete actions.

Here are some of the available Airflow functions and CLI commands that might help you achieve these operations:

1. Pausing or Unpausing a DAG
To update a DAG's status (e.g., deactivating or reactivating a DAG), you can use the following Airflow function or CLI command:

Python Function
In your DAG code or a custom Python script that interacts with Airflow’s metadata, you can use the airflow.models.DAG class to pause or unpause a DAG programmatically.

python
Copy code
from airflow.models import DagModel

# Pause a DAG
DagModel.get_dagmodel('your_dag_id').set_is_paused(True)

# Unpause a DAG
DagModel.get_dagmodel('your_dag_id').set_is_paused(False)
CLI Command
You can use the Airflow CLI to pause or unpause a DAG, which changes the is_paused state in the metadata database.

bash
Copy code
# Pause a DAG (Update operation)
airflow dags pause your_dag_id

# Unpause a DAG (Update operation)
airflow dags unpause your_dag_id
2. Deleting DAG Runs
While Airflow doesn't provide an explicit function to delete DAGs or task instances directly from the Python API, you can remove DAG runs and their associated task instances via the Airflow CLI.

CLI Command to Delete DAG Runs
You can use the CLI to delete DAG runs from the Airflow metadata:

bash
Copy code
airflow dags delete your_dag_id
This command removes the DAG from the Airflow UI (though the underlying DAG file will still exist, and the DAG will be re-registered if the file remains in the DAGs folder).

3. Manually Marking Task Instances
Airflow allows you to manually update task instances' states (which can act like an update operation).

Python Code to Update Task Instance State
If you want to update the state of a task instance, you can use Airflow’s ORM models to programmatically change the state.

python
Copy code
from airflow.models import TaskInstance
from airflow.utils.state import State
from airflow import settings

session = settings.Session()

# Update task instance state to "SUCCESS"
task_instance = session.query(TaskInstance).filter(
    TaskInstance.dag_id == 'your_dag_id',
    TaskInstance.task_id == 'your_task_id',
    TaskInstance.execution_date == '2024-09-17'
).one()

task_instance.state = State.SUCCESS
session.commit()
session.close()
This will update the task instance's state in the database, which might be useful for retrying or fixing a failed state.

4. Deleting Task Instances
You can delete task instances using the Airflow CLI if you want to clean up specific tasks.

bash
Copy code
# Delete failed task instances (Delete operation)
airflow tasks clear --only_failed your_dag_id
This clears all failed task instances for the DAG and can be useful for resetting tasks without deleting the entire DAG run.

5. Accessing the Airflow Metadata Database
If you really need to update or delete records in the metadata database (e.g., removing specific DAG runs, task instances, or logs), you will need to directly interact with the metadata database using SQL or through the database models.

However, Airflow doesn’t provide a specific built-in function for performing generic SQL UPDATE or DELETE queries. You can either:

Use SQLAlchemy models to manipulate metadata (as shown in the TaskInstance example above), or
Use custom Python logic in DAGs or operators to perform specific actions based on business logic.
Summary of Available Operations
Operation	Airflow Function/CLI	Example
Pause/Unpause DAG	DagModel.set_is_paused() or CLI	airflow dags pause your_dag_id
Update Task Instance	TaskInstance.state	Change task instance state
Delete DAG Runs	CLI	airflow dags delete your_dag_id
Delete Task Instances	CLI	airflow tasks clear your_dag_id
Conclusion:
While Airflow doesn’t provide direct functions for generic UPDATE or DELETE operations on its metadata database, it offers functions and CLI commands to pause/unpause DAGs, clear tasks, and delete DAG runs. If you need more control over the metadata, you can interact with the Airflow metadata database using SQLAlchemy models or directly execute SQL queries.






You said:
can i run shell script in python
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can run a shell script in Python using several methods. The most common ways are:

Using subprocess module: This is the recommended way for running shell commands in Python.
Using os.system(): This is a simpler but more limited option.
Using sh or pexpect modules: For more advanced use cases, though less commonly used.
Here’s how you can do it:

1. Using subprocess module (Recommended)
The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain return codes. You can use it to run shell scripts or individual shell commands.

Running a Shell Script
python
Copy code
import subprocess

# Path to your shell script
shell_script_path = "/path/to/your_script.sh"

# Run the script using subprocess
result = subprocess.run([shell_script_path], shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)

# Print the output and return code
print("STDOUT:", result.stdout)
print("STDERR:", result.stderr)
print("Return code:", result.returncode)
Running Shell Commands Directly
python
Copy code
import subprocess

# Run a shell command (e.g., list files)
result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Print the output
print(result.stdout)
2. Using os.system()
The os.system() function is a simpler way to run shell commands, but it doesn’t give you as much control as subprocess. It only returns the exit status of the command and doesn’t capture the command’s output.

Example:
python
Copy code
import os

# Run a shell script
exit_status = os.system("/path/to/your_script.sh")

# Check the status
print(f"Exit status: {exit_status}")
3. Using sh Module
The sh module is an external library that makes it easier to work with shell commands directly from Python.

Example:
python
Copy code
import sh

# Run a command using sh
output = sh.ls("-l")
print(output)
You'll need to install the sh module first by running pip install sh.

Conclusion:
For simple tasks and better control over input/output, use the subprocess module.
For basic use, os.system() works but is limited in terms of error handling and output capture.
For advanced shell interaction, you can consider the sh module, though it's less commonly needed.
Let me know if you need further details on any of these approaches!

Read the below instruction and let me know if there is way to update and delete the airflow database 

Run the DB maintenance DAG on a schedule
You can use the following maintenance DAG to prune the content of your database.

Make sure to run the maintenance DAG periodically to keep the database size below 16 GB. We recommend to run this DAG daily for most environments. If you observe that database size metric increases significantly between runs, consider running this DAG more often.

Choose a retention period (DEFAULT_MAX_DB_ENTRY_AGE_IN_DAYS) that allows keeping database below 16 GB. We recommend a period of 30 days as a starting point for most environments.

This DAG removes old entries from job, dag_run, task_instance, log, xcom, sla_miss, dags, task_reschedule, task_fail and import_error tables by default. In the DAG, review the list of tables and decide whether old entries must be removed from them. In general, most space savings are provided by cleaning log, task_instance, dag_run and xcom tables. To exclude a table from cleanup, modify the DAG and comment corresponding items in the DATABASE_OBJECTS list.

Airflow 2
Airflow 1


"""
A maintenance workflow that you can deploy into Airflow to periodically clean
out the DagRun, TaskInstance, Log, XCom, Job DB and SlaMiss entries to avoid
having too much data in your Airflow MetaStore.

## Authors

The DAG is a fork of [teamclairvoyant repository.](
https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/airflow-maintenance-dags/tree/master/db-cleanup
)

## Usage

1. Update the global variables (SCHEDULE_INTERVAL, DAG_OWNER_NAME,
  ALERT_EMAIL_ADDRESSES and ENABLE_DELETE) in the DAG with the desired values

2. Modify the DATABASE_OBJECTS list to add/remove objects as needed. Each
   dictionary in the list features the following parameters:
    - airflow_db_model: Model imported from airflow.models corresponding to
      a table in the airflow metadata database
    - age_check_column: Column in the model/table to use for calculating max
      date of data deletion
    - keep_last: Boolean to specify whether to preserve last run instance
        - keep_last_filters: List of filters to preserve data from deleting
          during clean-up, such as DAG runs where the external trigger is set
          to 0.
        - keep_last_group_by: Option to specify column by which to group the
          database entries and perform aggregate functions.

3. Create and Set the following Variables in the Airflow Web Server
  (Admin -> Variables)
    - airflow_db_cleanup__max_db_entry_age_in_days - integer - Length to
      retain the log files if not already provided in the conf. If this is set
      to 30, the job will remove those files that are 30 days old or older.

4. Put the DAG in your gcs bucket.

Yes, it is possible to update and delete the Airflow database as part of regular maintenance. Based on the instructions provided, the DB cleanup DAG is already designed to handle these tasks by periodically pruning the database and removing old entries from various tables.

Key Points for Updating and Deleting Airflow Database:
Scheduled Cleanup: You can schedule this maintenance DAG to run periodically, such as daily, to clean up old entries from the Airflow metadata database. This helps ensure that the database remains under the 16 GB limit and doesn't impact performance.

Customizable Retention: You can define the retention period (DEFAULT_MAX_DB_ENTRY_AGE_IN_DAYS) to specify how long records should be kept. For example, setting this value to 30 days means that any entries older than 30 days will be deleted. This can be customized as needed for different tables.

Database Table Pruning: The DAG is configured to remove old entries from tables such as dag_run, task_instance, log, xcom, etc. You can adjust which tables are cleaned up by modifying the DATABASE_OBJECTS list in the DAG.

Automatic Execution: The cleanup process is automated, and you don’t need to manually interact with the database. However, you can monitor or change the ENABLE_DELETE flag to temporarily disable the deletion process if necessary (e.g., for testing).

Managing Large Tables: The tables that contribute the most to database size (like log, task_instance, and xcom) can be cleaned up more frequently by adjusting the DAG schedule or retention period.

Error Handling: The DAG can send email alerts if it fails, so you can monitor the process and ensure the cleanup runs smoothly.

To Update/Delete Entries from the Airflow Database:
Modify Variables: Adjust DEFAULT_MAX_DB_ENTRY_AGE_IN_DAYS or table settings in DATABASE_OBJECTS.
Set Airflow Variables: Configure the airflow_db_cleanup__max_db_entry_age_in_days variable in the Airflow UI (Admin -> Variables).
Run the DAG: Once the DAG is placed in your environment, it will clean up the database according to the schedule and settings you’ve defined.
This method avoids manually interacting with the Airflow database and provides a cleaner, automated approach to managing database size.






You said:
Can you tell from the above instruction how to update the older dags information staying in airflow database 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The provided instructions focus primarily on cleaning or deleting old entries from the Airflow database, not updating them. However, if you want to update older DAG information (such as metadata like dag_run, task_instance, etc.), the approach would require modifying the corresponding records in the Airflow metadata database.

Here are some steps you can follow to update older DAG information:

1. Identify the Airflow Models
The Airflow database stores DAG information in several models, such as:

DagRun
TaskInstance
DagModel
XCom
Log
To update the information, you'll need to query and modify these tables based on your requirements.

2. Direct SQL Queries (Manual Update)
You can directly run SQL queries on your Airflow metadata database to update the older DAG information. You can access the Airflow database using SQLAlchemy or other SQL clients, depending on the database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) you're using with Airflow.

Here’s a simplified Python-based approach using SQLAlchemy:

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagRun
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
session = Session()

# Find the old DAG runs that you want to update
old_dag_runs = session.query(DagRun).filter(DagRun.execution_date <= '2023-01-01').all()

# Iterate through the results and modify the necessary fields
for dag_run in old_dag_runs:
    dag_run.state = 'success'  # For example, updating the state to 'success'
    dag_run.run_id = 'updated_run_id'  # Or updating the run_id

# Commit the changes
session.commit()

# Close the session
session.close()
3. Using a Custom Maintenance DAG (Automated Update)
You can modify the existing maintenance DAG or create a new one that runs periodically to update certain columns of DAG-related tables.

For example, you can adapt the provided cleanup DAG and write update logic instead of deletion in the build_query and print_query functions.

Example:

python
Copy code
def update_query(session, airflow_db_model, update_column, new_value, age_check_column, max_date):
    query = session.query(airflow_db_model).filter(age_check_column <= max_date)
    entries_to_update = query.all()
    for entry in entries_to_update:
        setattr(entry, update_column, new_value)  # Update the column with the new value
    session.commit()
4. Airflow Hooks (Using PythonOperator)
You can use Airflow’s PostgresHook (or MySqlHook) inside a custom DAG to execute SQL queries that update older DAG entries.

Example:

python
Copy code
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime

def update_dagrun_state(**kwargs):
    hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id='airflow_db')  # Replace with your connection ID
    sql = """
    UPDATE dag_run
    SET state = 'success'
    WHERE execution_date <= '2023-01-01';
    """
    hook.run(sql)

with DAG(dag_id='update_dagrun', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
    update_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='update_dagrun_state',
        python_callable=update_dagrun_state,
        provide_context=True
    )
Considerations:
Ensure that the Airflow database isn't overloaded during these updates, as large-scale updates can impact performance.
Test updates in a non-production environment before implementing them in production, especially if dealing with critical metadata like dag_run or task_instance.
Ensure consistency between models, especially if you're modifying dependent tables like DagRun and TaskInstance.
This should help you systematically update older DAG information in the Airflow database.






You said:
Suppose postgresql has older dag infomation recored in dag table with flag is_active = f ,
how can i make it is_active = t 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To update the is_active flag for older DAG information in the dag table (or the equivalent table holding DAG metadata) from f (false) to t (true) in PostgreSQL, you can run an SQL query directly on the PostgreSQL database.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve that:

1. Direct SQL Query in PostgreSQL
The following SQL query will update the is_active field in the dag table:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE dag 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE is_active = false;
This query will:

Set is_active = true for all records where is_active = false.
You can run this query directly if you have access to a PostgreSQL client (e.g., psql), or using tools like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or any other SQL client.

2. Running the Query from Airflow (Using a DAG with PostgresHook)
If you want to automate this process in Airflow, you can create a DAG that uses the PostgresHook to execute the same SQL query within a Python function.

Here’s an example of how to do this using Airflow’s PostgresHook:

Python Code for Airflow DAG:
python
Copy code
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Function to update is_active flag in the dag table
def update_is_active_flag():
    hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id='your_postgres_conn_id')  # Use the connection ID for your PostgreSQL DB
    sql = """
    UPDATE dag 
    SET is_active = true 
    WHERE is_active = false;
    """
    hook.run(sql)

# Define the DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id='update_is_active_dag_flag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,  # Set to None to make it a manually triggered DAG
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    
    # Task to run the update query
    update_flag_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='update_is_active_flag_task',
        python_callable=update_is_active_flag
    )

# The task will be triggered as part of the DAG's run
Explanation:
PostgresHook: This is used to connect to the PostgreSQL database in your Airflow environment. You should ensure that postgres_conn_id matches the connection settings for your PostgreSQL metadata database.
SQL Query: The same UPDATE dag SET is_active = true WHERE is_active = false query is used within the update_is_active_flag function.
DAG Definition: This DAG runs the Python task to update the flag. You can trigger it manually or schedule it if needed.
3. Command Line with psql
Alternatively, if you have access to the PostgreSQL database via the command line (psql), you can execute the query like this:

bash
Copy code
psql -U username -d airflow_db -c "UPDATE dag SET is_active = true WHERE is_active = false;"
Considerations:
Check your PostgreSQL schema: Ensure the dag table exists in the correct schema (usually public) and that the column name is exactly is_active.
Test first: Before running this on production data, it’s always a good idea to test the query on a small subset of data to ensure it behaves as expected.
This process will update the is_active flag for older DAGs in the PostgreSQL database.






You said:
But this will create dag for it , right , I want this to be handle without me triggering it from aiflow ui
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To update the is_active flag for older DAGs in the Airflow database without triggering a DAG from the Airflow UI (and without the need to use a DAG at all), you can directly execute the SQL query within PostgreSQL, either manually or through a scheduled PostgreSQL job. Here’s how you can handle it:

1. Directly Update PostgreSQL Database
You can connect directly to the PostgreSQL database used by Airflow and update the is_active flag without interacting with Airflow’s UI or triggering any DAGs. The SQL query below will achieve this:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE dag 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE is_active = false;
You can run this SQL query through any PostgreSQL client (like psql, pgAdmin, etc.) or use a scheduled job within PostgreSQL.

2. Automating the Process Without Airflow DAGs
If you want to automate this update without Airflow’s involvement (so no UI trigger is needed), you have a few options:

Option A: Cron Job or Shell Script
You can create a cron job on your server that periodically runs the SQL query using the psql command-line tool. Here’s an example of how you can set this up:

Create a Shell Script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
psql -U your_username -d airflow_db -c "UPDATE dag SET is_active = true WHERE is_active = false;"
Save this script as something like update_dag_status.sh.

Schedule the Cron Job:

Open the crontab for editing:

bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add the following line to run the script every day at midnight (or adjust as per your needs):

bash
Copy code
0 0 * * * /path/to/update_dag_status.sh
Option B: PostgreSQL Scheduled Job
PostgreSQL has the ability to schedule jobs using an extension like pg_cron. If you have this extension enabled, you can schedule the SQL query to run at regular intervals directly within PostgreSQL.

Enable pg_cron (if not already enabled):

Install the pg_cron extension on your PostgreSQL server, and then load it into your database.

sql
Copy code
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
Schedule the Job:

Once the extension is available, you can schedule the query to run at your desired interval, like this:

sql
Copy code
SELECT cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', 'UPDATE dag SET is_active = true WHERE is_active = false');
This schedules the query to run daily at midnight.

Option C: Use External Scheduling Tools
If your environment uses any external job scheduling or orchestration tools (like Jenkins, Rundeck, etc.), you can create a scheduled job in those tools to run the SQL query periodically.

Conclusion
By running the SQL query directly in the PostgreSQL database and automating it with a cron job, pg_cron, or an external scheduler, you can update the is_active flag for older DAGs without triggering any DAGs from Airflow or interacting with the UI.

This way, you ensure that the process stays outside of Airflow and is managed directly in PostgreSQL, solving your requirement to not use Airflow’s UI or DAG triggering mechanism.

Your code snippet demonstrates how to update records in the DagRun table using SQLAlchemy within Airflow. It directly interacts with the Airflow database without the need to trigger anything from the UI. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:

Creating a Session:

sessionmaker is used to create a session that interacts with the database. This is necessary for querying and updating records in the Airflow metadata database.
Querying the Database:

The session.query(DagRun).filter(DagRun.execution_date <= '2023-01-01').all() fetches all DAG runs before 2023-01-01. You can modify the filter condition to match the DAG runs you want to update.
Updating Fields:

For each DagRun object in old_dag_runs, you modify the state and run_id. You can update any field that is part of the DagRun model, such as is_active.
Committing Changes:

session.commit() applies the changes to the database. It’s important to always commit the session after making updates.
Closing the Session:

After the updates, the session is closed to release the resources.
Example for Setting is_active = True
If you are specifically looking to update the is_active field of DAGs in the dag table, you could adapt this code like so:

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagModel  # Import DagModel instead of DagRun
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
session = Session()

# Find the old DAGs that are inactive (is_active = False)
old_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

# Iterate through the results and set them to active
for dag in old_dags:
    dag.is_active = True  # Set is_active to True

# Commit the changes
session.commit()

# Close the session
session.close()
Explanation:
DagModel: This model represents the DAG table in the Airflow metadata database.
is_active: This field determines whether a DAG is active or not.
Filter: In this case, the filter DagModel.is_active == False is used to find all inactive DAGs. You can customize the query further if needed.
This method should activate the older DAGs without having to manually trigger anything from the Airflow UI.

Hi Vaibhav. Just need your suggestion.

We have thought to do insert, update and delete operation to airflow database using airflow.py. is it ethical to do so, i mean can we manipulate PostgreSQL database records. Just want to know your take on this.

Dahiya, Vaibhav (IST) 9:32 PM

Hi Dipak

no it should be done via proper tcm

direct queries are not permitted we should use runway
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems that your colleague Vaibhav suggested that directly manipulating the Airflow database through insert, update, and delete operations is not recommended and should be done through a proper Change Management Process (TCM). They also mentioned using a tool called "Runway."

Why Direct DB Manipulation is Risky:
Data Integrity: Manually updating the metadata tables can lead to inconsistent states if other parts of Airflow rely on certain workflows.
Bypassing Airflow: When you manually modify the database, you're bypassing Airflow's built-in logic, which could lead to unexpected behavior, especially if you don't follow the exact workflow Airflow expects.
Upgrades and Changes: Airflow may update its database schema during upgrades, and any custom manipulations you perform might break in the future.
Proper Approach:
Runway: This might refer to internal tools or processes within your organization designed to handle database changes in a controlled and standardized way.
Airflow APIs: Airflow provides APIs and hooks to interact with DAGs, tasks, and other components. It’s safer to use those rather than direct database access.
TCM: Following a proper Change Management Process ensures that changes are tracked, reviewed, and approved before they’re applied to the system.
My Take:
It’s generally best to avoid direct manipulation of the Airflow metadata database unless there’s no other option, and even then, it should be done with caution. Always explore official APIs, plugins, or management tools that interact with Airflow safely.

How to delete the dag from airflow.py
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To delete a DAG in Airflow, it is important to understand that you need to remove references from multiple locations: the DAG file itself, and the associated metadata in the Airflow database.

Safe and Recommended Approach
Delete the DAG file:

The first step in deleting a DAG is to remove or rename the Python file that defines the DAG from the dags_folder.
Airflow periodically scans the dags_folder and will detect when a file is removed or renamed. This will cause the DAG to no longer appear in the Airflow UI.
Clear the DAG Metadata:

Airflow will still have metadata (DAG runs, task instances, etc.) for the deleted DAG in its database. To remove the metadata, you can use the following command via the Airflow CLI:
bash
Copy code
airflow dags delete <dag_id>
This will:

Remove the DAG’s metadata from the database (such as DAG runs, task instances, etc.).
It will not, however, remove the DAG file itself. You must manually remove it from the dags_folder.
Programmatically via airflow.py
If you want to automate this via the airflow.py script (or your Python environment where Airflow is already set up), you can use Airflow's internal commands, but make sure to use this carefully.

Here’s an example of how you can achieve this in a Python script:

python
Copy code
from airflow.models import DagBag
from airflow.api.common.experimental import delete_dag

# Load all the DAGs in the dags folder
dag_bag = DagBag()

# Specify the dag_id of the DAG you want to delete
dag_id = 'your_dag_id'

# Check if the DAG exists
if dag_id in dag_bag.dags:
    # Remove DAG and its associated metadata
    delete_dag.delete_dag(dag_id)
    print(f'DAG {dag_id} and its metadata have been deleted.')
else:
    print(f'DAG {dag_id} does not exist.')
Steps:
Import the necessary functions: You’ll use delete_dag from Airflow's experimental API.
Load the DAGs: Use DagBag to load the current DAGs.
Check if the DAG exists: Verify whether the DAG you want to delete exists.
Delete the DAG and its metadata: The delete_dag function removes all traces of the DAG from the metadata database.
Important Notes:
Remove the DAG File: This method will remove metadata but not the DAG file itself. You still need to manually remove or rename the .py file.
Use with Caution: Ensure you’re not unintentionally deleting critical data. Always back up important DAG data before deletion.
Alternative: Clear DAG Runs and Task Instances
If you don’t want to delete the DAG entirely but clear its runs or task instances, you can use the Airflow CLI:

bash
Copy code
airflow dags clear <dag_id> --yes
This command will clear the DAG runs and task instances but leave the DAG in place.

Now I want something like 
How to set the older dag active flag to true if I don't provide any dags information 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To set the is_active flag to True for all older DAGs in Airflow's metadata database without providing specific DAG information, you can achieve this by writing a script that interacts with the Airflow database. This script would update the is_active flag for all DAGs that have it set to False (inactive) without needing to specify individual DAG IDs.

Here’s how you can do it:

Steps:
Access the Airflow metadata database using a SQLAlchemy session (the Airflow settings provides the engine).
Query the dag table to identify all inactive DAGs (is_active = False).
Update the is_active flag to True for those DAGs.
Commit the changes to the database.
Here's an example Python script that you can run in the Airflow environment:

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
session = Session()

# Query all DAGs where is_active is False
inactive_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

# Set the is_active flag to True for all inactive DAGs
for dag in inactive_dags:
    dag.is_active = True

# Commit the changes to the database
session.commit()

# Close the session
session.close()

print("Successfully activated all inactive DAGs.")
Explanation:
Session: A connection to the Airflow database is established using the SQLAlchemy session.
Query: All DAGs with is_active = False are fetched from the DagModel table.
Update: The is_active field for each inactive DAG is set to True.
Commit: Changes are committed to the database to make them persistent.
Close: The session is closed after the operation is completed.
This script will activate all DAGs in the Airflow database that are currently inactive. It doesn't require specific DAG IDs, so it will apply the update globally across all inactive DAGs.






You said:
Is there something in airflow.cfg file that can handle it without writing any code.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, there is nothing in the airflow.cfg configuration file that directly handles reactivating DAGs (setting the is_active flag to True) without writing custom code. The airflow.cfg file is mainly used to configure Airflow's core settings, such as:

Scheduler, web server, and executor configurations
Paths for DAGs, logs, and plugins
Database connection information
Time zone and logging configurations
However, DAG activation and deactivation is considered more of an operational task handled via the Airflow UI or programmatically via scripts, as you would typically need fine-grained control over which DAGs to activate.

The is_active flag for DAGs is managed in the database and is not controlled by any Airflow configuration setting in airflow.cfg. If you need to manage DAG activation and deactivation programmatically or automatically, it would need to be done through the database or via Airflow's internal APIs, as previously described.

In summary:

No option in airflow.cfg to handle setting is_active = True for older DAGs.
This type of operation is best handled through custom scripts, SQL commands, or via the Airflow UI/API.





You said:
Actually I always want all  my older dags to be active by default if I have no current dag info 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To ensure that all older DAGs are always active by default in Airflow (even if you don't have current DAG information), this will likely require a custom approach. There isn't a built-in configuration in Airflow to automatically reactivate older DAGs without some form of custom logic.

Here are some possible approaches you can consider:

Option 1: Custom Script to Reactivate Older DAGs Automatically
You could write a Python script that periodically runs and checks the Airflow metadata database to ensure that all DAGs (including older ones) have the is_active = True flag set.

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
session = Session()

# Query all older DAGs that are inactive
inactive_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

# Iterate through the results and set is_active to True
for dag in inactive_dags:
    dag.is_active = True

# Commit the changes
session.commit()

# Close the session
session.close()
You could run this script as part of a cron job or on a schedule using the Airflow DAG itself.

Option 2: Modify the Scheduler Behavior (Less Recommended)
If you want to always activate DAGs automatically, you could consider modifying the Airflow scheduler or overriding certain hooks in the Airflow source code to set is_active = True by default when processing DAGs. However, this is not recommended, as it involves altering Airflow's core functionality, which can lead to issues in future updates or compatibility.

Option 3: Set DAGs Active via API
Airflow provides a REST API that can be used to manipulate DAGs, including setting them as active. You could create a small service that checks the state of older DAGs and activates them via the API if needed. Here is an example API call that activates a DAG:

bash
Copy code
curl -X PATCH "http://<your-airflow-url>/api/v1/dags/<dag_id>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"is_paused": false}'
You can loop through all your inactive DAGs and activate them using this API.

Option 4: Always Keep DAGs Active with Custom Trigger (Airflow DAG)
Another alternative is to create a dedicated Airflow DAG that runs on a schedule (e.g., daily) and ensures all DAGs in the metadata database are active:

python
Copy code
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def activate_all_dags():
    from airflow.models import DagModel
    from airflow import settings
    session = settings.Session()

    # Query all inactive DAGs and set them to active
    inactive_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

    for dag in inactive_dags:
        dag.is_active = True

    session.commit()
    session.close()

# Define the DAG
default_args = {
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1,
}
dag = DAG('activate_older_dags', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

# Define the task
activate_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='activate_inactive_dags',
    python_callable=activate_all_dags,
    dag=dag,
)
Option 5: Use External Tools to Monitor and Reactivate DAGs
You could also leverage external monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, or write custom monitoring scripts, to track the state of DAGs and trigger reactivation when needed.

Conclusion
There isn't a direct configuration in airflow.cfg to activate all DAGs automatically, but the custom approaches described above should meet your needs. The most straightforward solution would likely be to write a periodic task within Airflow (using the PythonOperator or a standalone script) to activate older DAGs.

For All Dags:

Change dags_are_paused_at_creation to False in airflow.cfg.

You will find it in [core] section.

[core]
# Are DAGs paused by default at creation
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False
Single DAG: If you do not want to change it for all DAGs, you can set is_paused_upon_creation=True when creating DAG object.

Example:

dag = DAG(
    DAG_NAME, 
    schedule_interval='*/10 * * * *', 
    default_args=default_args, 
    is_paused_upon_creation=True)

Based on the information you provided, the simplest way to ensure that all your DAGs (including older ones) are active by default is to modify the airflow.cfg file by setting the dags_are_paused_at_creation option to False. This way, all new DAGs will be active by default upon creation, and you won’t need to manually activate them.

Here's how you can configure it:

Open airflow.cfg: Locate your airflow.cfg file in your Airflow setup (it's typically located in the Airflow home directory).

Modify the dags_are_paused_at_creation flag: In the [core] section, find the dags_are_paused_at_creation option and set it to False:

ini
Copy code
[core]
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False
By setting this flag to False, all DAGs, including older ones, will be active upon being loaded into Airflow.

Restart Airflow: After making this change, restart your Airflow services (scheduler, web server, etc.) for the changes to take effect.

Important Notes:
For all DAGs: This change will ensure that DAGs will not be paused when they are created or when they are reloaded from the metadata database.

For individual DAGs: If you prefer to control this behavior on a per-DAG basis, you can override the default behavior by using the is_paused_upon_creation parameter in the DAG definition:

python
Copy code
dag = DAG(
    'your_dag_name',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    is_paused_upon_creation=False
)
This should solve the issue without needing to write additional code to handle reactivation of older DAGs.






You said:
Does this mean , i dags information is not given in next iteration , I will still have older dag available in airflow ui
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, changing the dags_are_paused_at_creation = False option in the airflow.cfg ensures that all new DAGs (or reloaded DAGs) are active by default, but it does not control whether older DAGs remain available in the Airflow UI if they are not explicitly provided in the next iteration.

Here's the distinction:
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False: This ensures that any DAG loaded into Airflow (whether new or reloaded) will not be paused by default, but it does not guarantee that older DAGs will remain visible in the Airflow UI if they are not part of the current DAG folder or the DAG files are missing in the next refresh.

Older DAG Availability:

Airflow looks for DAG definitions in the specified DAG folder (dags_folder in the airflow.cfg).
If a DAG file is missing or removed from that folder, the DAG will disappear from the UI after the next refresh cycle.
The is_active flag in the database simply determines whether a DAG is displayed in the UI or not, but the DAG's file must still exist in the DAG folder for it to be loaded.
Solution to Keep Older DAGs Active:
If you want all older DAGs to stay available, you must ensure that their corresponding DAG definition files remain in the dags_folder. If you remove the DAG file, Airflow will no longer recognize it, regardless of the is_active flag.

Key Points:
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False will ensure that any DAG loaded will not be paused.
To keep older DAGs available in the Airflow UI, their DAG definition files must still exist in the dags_folder. If those files are missing, the DAG will no longer show up, even if it was active in previous iterations.

To ensure that all your older DAGs remain active in the Airflow UI, even if no new DAG information is provided in subsequent iterations, here’s a potential approach you could take:

1. Modify the airflow.cfg:
Update the Airflow configuration file to automatically activate any new or existing DAGs when loaded. This will prevent DAGs from being paused by default.

Edit airflow.cfg:

Set dags_are_paused_at_creation to False under the [core] section.
ini
Copy code
[core]
# Are DAGs paused by default at creation
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False
This will ensure all DAGs, whether old or newly loaded, remain active.

2. Use a Custom Python Script for DAG Activation:
In case you need more control, you can create a Python script to run periodically, which will check the is_active flag for older DAGs and update it if necessary. This script can be added as an Airflow task or triggered externally to check for inactive DAGs and reactivate them.

Example:

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a session to interact with the database
Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
session = Session()

# Find all inactive DAGs
inactive_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

# Iterate and update the 'is_active' flag to True for each inactive DAG
for dag in inactive_dags:
    dag.is_active = True

# Commit changes to the database
session.commit()

# Close the session
session.close()
3. Automate the DAG Activation Using a Scheduled Task:
To automate the reactivation process for older DAGs, schedule the Python script above as a task in Airflow (using PythonOperator) or schedule it via cron to run at a specific interval.

4. Ensure DAG Files Are Available:
Ensure that the DAG files for older DAGs are always available in the dags_folder, as Airflow needs them for any action to be taken on them.

5. Database Approach (Optional):
If you want to handle this directly in the database without using Python scripts, you could create a recurring job in PostgreSQL to update the is_active flag for any inactive DAGs periodically. However, directly manipulating the database is not recommended for routine operations.

By implementing these steps, you can ensure that older DAGs remain active in the Airflow UI, even if no new DAG information is provided. The first method (airflow.cfg change) is the simplest approach, while the Python script offers greater control if needed.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Running the above code every 30 seconds may not damage your PostgreSQL database, but it could introduce a few potential risks and inefficiencies:

1. High Database Load:
Querying and updating the DagModel table every 30 seconds could lead to unnecessary database load, especially if the table contains a large number of records. Even if there are no inactive DAGs, the query will still execute and potentially lock the table when updating.
2. Database Locking:
Frequent updates on the DagModel table could cause database locking, as the table is modified each time the inactive DAGs are updated. This could lead to contention with other processes that rely on the same table, potentially causing slowdowns.
3. Redundant Updates:
Running this script every 30 seconds could result in repeated updates to the same set of inactive DAGs, even if no new changes have been made. If there are no inactive DAGs, the query and update still execute unnecessarily.
4. Performance Bottleneck:
If your Airflow environment is large with many DAGs, the constant querying of the DagModel table could degrade the performance of the PostgreSQL instance, impacting other operations in Airflow.
Recommendations for Safe Execution:
Check for Changes Before Updating:

Modify the script to only update the database if there are actual changes (i.e., if new inactive DAGs are detected). This will reduce unnecessary updates.
Increase the Time Interval:

Consider increasing the time interval between executions. Instead of 30 seconds, a longer interval like 5 or 10 minutes might be more appropriate unless you need extremely rapid changes.
Use a Conditional Update:

Perform a conditional update in SQL directly, which can update all records in a single transaction if needed, instead of iterating over each record in Python. This reduces overhead.
Example:

python
Copy code
session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).update({'is_active': True})
session.commit()
Monitor Database Performance:

If you proceed with frequent updates, monitor PostgreSQL performance (e.g., query execution times, locking, and CPU/memory usage) to ensure the load is manageable.
Use Airflow’s Built-in Mechanisms:

Consider using Airflow’s own process management and scheduling features to handle DAG activation/deactivation instead of frequent direct updates to the database.
Conclusion:
While running the script every 30 seconds is not likely to damage your PostgreSQL database, it could lead to inefficiencies, database locking, and performance issues. You can minimize this by optimizing the update logic, increasing the time interval, and monitoring your system closely.

It seems the code and approach you're referring to for managing Airflow DAGs programmatically aren't directly linked to a specific page or repository, but it can be referenced and adapted based on general Airflow documentation and community practices.

Here's a general reference to Airflow’s official documentation on DAG management and interacting with the database:

Airflow Documentation on DAGs:

Airflow DAGs - Overview of DAGs in Airflow, including creation, management, and scheduling.
Airflow Documentation on Using the Airflow API:

Airflow REST API - Useful for interacting with DAGs programmatically.
SQLAlchemy Documentation:

SQLAlchemy ORM Documentation - For understanding how to use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database.
Airflow Source Code and Examples:

Airflow GitHub Repository - The official source code and examples, including how DAGs and other models are managed.
To find more specific examples or implementations similar to the code you provided, you might want to check forums, GitHub repositories, or community discussions related to Apache Airflow and SQLAlchemy.

See I will tell you what is happening,
If I provide the dag information , the dag will appear in the airflow ui , 
Next time if the airflow dag processor don't find that dags, then it will hide the dag from airflow ui ,
I don't want this to happen

To ensure that your DAGs remain active in the Airflow UI even if they are not provided in the DAG folder for subsequent runs, you can follow these steps:

1. Set Default Behavior in airflow.cfg
Ensure that new DAGs are not paused by default. Set the following configuration in your airflow.cfg:

ini
Copy code
[core]
# Are DAGs paused by default at creation
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False
This setting ensures that DAGs are active by default when they are first created.

2. Use a Custom DAG Processor Script
Since you want to keep the DAGs active even if they are not found in the DAGs folder during subsequent scans, you can periodically run a script to ensure inactive DAGs are reactivated. Here is a Python script using SQLAlchemy to achieve this:

python
Copy code
from airflow import settings
from airflow.models import DagModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

def activate_inactive_dags():
    # Create a session to interact with the database
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=settings.engine)
    session = Session()

    # Find all inactive DAGs
    inactive_dags = session.query(DagModel).filter(DagModel.is_active == False).all()

    # Iterate and update the 'is_active' flag to True for each inactive DAG
    for dag in inactive_dags:
        dag.is_active = True

    # Commit changes to the database
    session.commit()

    # Close the session
    session.close()

# Run the function to activate inactive DAGs
activate_inactive_dags()
3. Schedule the Script
You can schedule this script to run periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds) using a cron job or a scheduled task in your operating system.

4. Ensure Proper DAG Folder Configuration
In your Airflow settings, ensure that the dags_folder is correctly configured to point to the directory containing your DAG files. If you are using a dynamic DAG generation approach, ensure the scripts generate DAGs as expected.

5. Monitor and Test
After setting up the script, monitor your Airflow UI and logs to ensure that the DAGs remain active and that there are no unintended side effects.

Summary
By setting dags_are_paused_at_creation to False and running a periodic script to reactivate inactive DAGs, you can ensure that DAGs remain visible and active in the Airflow UI even if they are not present in the DAG folder during subsequent scans.

By just keeping the first point, will it not be enough

Setting dags_are_paused_at_creation = False in the airflow.cfg will indeed make sure that any new DAGs added to the DAG folder are active by default when they are initially detected by Airflow. However, this setting alone won't address the issue of DAGs disappearing from the UI when they are no longer present in the DAG folder.

Here’s why you might still need additional steps:

Default Setting Behavior:

The dags_are_paused_at_creation = False setting affects only new DAGs being added to Airflow. It does not impact the state of DAGs that were previously active and then later removed from the DAG folder. If Airflow’s DAG processor does not find a DAG file during its periodic scans, it will mark the DAG as inactive (or hide it).
Handling Missing DAGs:

Airflow's default behavior is to hide or deactivate DAGs that are no longer present in the specified DAG folder. This behavior is typically intended to keep the UI clean and avoid clutter with stale or removed DAGs.
Custom Requirements:

If your goal is to keep all historical DAGs active or ensure that DAGs do not disappear from the UI when they are removed from the folder, you would need to implement a custom solution, such as the periodic script mentioned earlier, to ensure inactive DAGs are reactivated.
Summary
dags_are_paused_at_creation = False: Ensures new DAGs are not paused when first detected.
Periodic Script: Ensures DAGs that were previously active remain so even if removed from the DAG folder.
If your main concern is to maintain DAG visibility and activity in the UI regardless of their presence in the DAG folder, you will likely need the periodic script to keep those DAGs active. The configuration setting alone will not fully address this requirement.
