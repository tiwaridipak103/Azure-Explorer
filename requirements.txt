Nice — thanks for the clear tree description. Below I’ll give you a practical, ready-to-run set of hierarchical model designs (concept + code) for the tree:

United_state (root)
→ 10 markets (market_0 .. market_9)
→ each market has 5 submarkets (so 50 submarkets total; nested under markets)

I’ll assume a continuous outcome y (e.g., price, sales). If your outcome is binary or counts, I’ll add alternatives at the end. I’ll also assume you might want both varying intercepts and optionally varying slopes for one or more predictors. If you want a plain intercept-only multilevel model, you can drop the slope parts.

1) Model outline (mathematical)

Indexing:

i indexes observations (rows).

m[i] ∈ {0..9} is the market index for observation i.

s[i] ∈ {0..49} is the submarket index for observation i. Each submarket has a known parent market market_of_sub[s].


Basic 3-level hierarchical model (varying intercepts):

\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma_y)\\
\mu_i &= \alpha_{US} + \alpha^{(M)}_{m[i]} + \alpha^{(S)}_{s[i]} + X_i \beta\\
\alpha_{US} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{US})\ \text{(could be fixed 0)}\\
\alpha^{(M)}_m &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_M) \quad m=0,\dots,9\\
\alpha^{(S)}_s &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_S) \quad s=0,\dots,49\\
\sigma_y, \sigma_M, \sigma_S &>0 \text{ (hyperpriors)}
\end{aligned}

If you want varying slopes for a predictor x1 at market level:

\mu_i = \alpha_{US} + \alpha^{(M)}_{m[i]} + \alpha^{(S)}_{s[i]} + \big(\beta_{0} + \beta^{(M)}_{m[i]}\big) x_{1,i} + X_{-1,i} \beta_{-1}

2) Data preparation notes

Create integer indices:

market_idx ∈ {0..9}

submarket_idx ∈ {0..49}


Also create a market_of_sub array mapping each submarket index to its parent market index.

Center / standardize continuous predictors — helps sampling and interpretability.


Example mapping in pandas:

# pseudo
df['market_idx'] = df['market'].astype('category').cat.codes
df['submarket_idx'] = df['market'].astype(str) + '_' + df['submarket'].astype(str)
df['submarket_idx'] = df['submarket_idx'].astype('category').cat.codes
# build market_of_sub: for each submarket id, what's the market id
market_of_sub = df[['submarket_idx','market_idx']].drop_duplicates().sort_values('submarket_idx')['market_idx'].values

3) PyMC (Bayesian) implementation (full example)

This is a practical PyMC model implementing varying intercepts at market and submarket and an optional varying slope for x1 at market level.

# PyMC example (PyMC v4+/aesara)
import numpy as np
import pymc as pm
import arviz as az

# Inputs you must prepare:
# y: (N,) numpy array
# x1: (N,) predictor (centered)
# X_other: (N, P) other predictors (already standardized) or None
# market_idx: (N,) ints in 0..9
# submarket_idx: (N,) ints in 0..49
# market_of_sub: (S,) ints linking submarket->market (length S=50)

N = len(y)
n_markets = max(market_idx) + 1        # 10
n_submarkets = max(submarket_idx) + 1  # 50

with pm.Model() as model:
    # Hyperpriors for SDs
    sigma_y = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_y", sigma=1.0)
    sigma_M = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_M", sigma=1.0)
    sigma_S = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_S", sigma=1.0)
    
    # Global intercept (alpha_US)
    alpha_US = pm.Normal("alpha_US", mu=0.0, sigma=5.0)
    
    # Market-level varying intercepts
    alpha_M_raw = pm.Normal("alpha_M_raw", mu=0.0, sigma=1.0, shape=n_markets)
    alpha_M = pm.Deterministic("alpha_M", alpha_M_raw * sigma_M)
    
    # Submarket-level varying intercepts (centered per usual)
    alpha_S_raw = pm.Normal("alpha_S_raw", mu=0.0, sigma=1.0, shape=n_submarkets)
    alpha_S = pm.Deterministic("alpha_S", alpha_S_raw * sigma_S)
    
    # Fixed effect for x1
    beta_x1 = pm.Normal("beta_x1", mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)
    
    # Optional: varying slope for x1 at market level (uncomment to use)
    use_varying_slope = True
    if use_varying_slope:
        sigma_beta_M = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_beta_M", sigma=1.0)
        beta_M_raw = pm.Normal("beta_M_raw", 0.0, 1.0, shape=n_markets)
        beta_M = pm.Deterministic("beta_M", beta_M_raw * sigma_beta_M)
    else:
        beta_M = np.zeros(n_markets)
    
    # Optional additional fixed covariates
    # X_other: shape (N, P), beta_other shape (P,)
    # beta_other = pm.Normal('beta_other', mu=0, sigma=1, shape=P)
    
    # Expected value
    mu = (alpha_US 
          + alpha_M[market_idx] 
          + alpha_S[submarket_idx]
          + (beta_x1 + (beta_M[market_idx] if use_varying_slope else 0.0)) * x1
         )
    # add other fixed covariates: + X_other.dot(beta_other)
    
    y_obs = pm.Normal("y_obs", mu=mu, sigma=sigma_y, observed=y)
    
    # Sample
    trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, target_accept=0.9)
    az.summary(trace, var_names=["alpha_US","sigma_y","sigma_M","sigma_S","beta_x1","sigma_beta_M"])

Notes:

alpha_M_raw and alpha_S_raw are standard-normal and scaled — common practice for hierarchical priors.

If you want correlation between market intercept and slope, replace alpha_M_raw and beta_M_raw with a bivariate MVN with a 2×2 covariance (I can show that if you want).

4) lme4 (R) — quick formula if you prefer frequentist

If you prefer lme4 in R, a simple random intercepts model:

# intercepts for market and submarket nested
lmer(y ~ x1 + (1 | market) + (1 | market:submarket), data = df)

# if varying slope for x1 at market-level:
lmer(y ~ x1 + (1 + x1 | market) + (1 | market:submarket), data = df)

market:submarket enforces nesting. You can also use (1 | submarket) if submarket IDs are globally unique and already encode parent market (i.e., submarket IDs aren't repeated across markets).


---

5) Stan (for multivariate market intercept/slope correlation)

If you want correlation between intercept and slope at market-level, Stan multivariate normal is typical. Sketch (pseudo):

data { int<lower=1> N; int<lower=1> M; int<lower=1> S;
       int market_idx[N]; int submarket_idx[N];
       vector[N] x1; vector[N] y; int market_of_sub[S]; }
parameters {
  real alpha_us;
  vector[2] mu_M; // not needed
  cholesky_factor_corr[2] L_Omega_M;
  vector<lower=0>[2] tau_M;
  matrix[2,M] z_M; // raw
  vector[S] alpha_S_raw;
  real<lower=0> sigma_S;
  real<lower=0> sigma_y;
  real beta_global;
}
transformed parameters {
  matrix[2,M] b_M = diag_pre_multiply(tau_M, L_Omega_M) * z_M;
  // b_M[1,m] intercept dev, b_M[2,m] slope dev
}
model {
  // priors ...
  for (n in 1:N)
    y[n] ~ normal(alpha_us + b_M[1, market_idx[n]] + alpha_S_raw[submarket_idx[n]] 
                 + (beta_global + b_M[2, market_idx[n]]) * x1[n], sigma_y);
}

Tell me if you want a full Stan file and I’ll paste a copy.

6) Practical tips & diagnostics

Center continuous predictors (especially x1) — reduces correlation between intercept and slope.

Priors: set sensible weakly-informative priors (e.g., normal(0,1) for standardized predictors). Use HalfNormal(1) for scale hyperpriors.

Check pooling: inspect posterior SDs sigma_M, sigma_S. If sigma_S ≈ 0, submarket-level adds little.

Posterior predictive checks (ppc) — always run az.plot_ppc / pm.sample_posterior_predictive to compare predicted vs observed.

Model comparison: compare simpler (no varying slopes) vs richer models with LOO/WAIC or leave-one-market-out checks.

If many predictors: consider group-level regularization (horseshoe, hierarchical shrinkage) or dimensionality reduction.

If time series: extend to include temporal correlation (AR terms) at appropriate levels.

7) Binary outcome / counts

Binary: replace y_obs ~ Normal with pm.Bernoulli("y_obs", logit_p=logit_p, observed=y) where logit_p = mu and mu becomes linear predictor.

Counts: use pm.Poisson or pm.NegativeBinomial with log(mu) = linear_predictor.

8) Next steps I can do for you (pick any — no need to answer now if you already know)

Produce a fully runnable PyMC notebook with simulated example data (I can include simulation code and sampling commands).

Provide a full Stan .stan file ready to compile.

Convert to a glmer/lme4-ready R script and show diagnostics there.

Add correlated random effects (market intercept–slope covariance) example in PyMC or Stan.

Adapt the model for binary/count outcome or include time component.

If you want, I can immediately produce a runnable PyMC notebook that simulates data for your exact tree (United_state → 10 markets → 5 submarkets each), fits the model, and shows diagnostic plots and summaries. Or I can produce the full Stan file. Which one would you like me to generate now?
