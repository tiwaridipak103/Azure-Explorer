Subject: Request to Restrict GitHub Personal Account Login on Company Devices

Hi [Leader's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to propose a security measure regarding GitHub access from company laptops.
Specifically, I request that we disable the ability for users to log in to personal GitHub accounts (such as accounts linked to personal emails like Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) from company devices.

However, users should still be able to:

View public repositories on GitHub without any restrictions.

Log in using their organization credentials (e.g., dipak.tiwari@abc.com) to access and collaborate on official company repositories.


Implementing this would help strengthen our data security posture by ensuring that company devices are only used for authorized GitHub activities, while still allowing access to necessary public resources.

Please let me know if you'd like me to provide more details or draft a proposed implementation plan.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
Dipak Tiwari
