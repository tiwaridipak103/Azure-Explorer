We are working on Moody's dataset with multiple features and responses for each market.It is quarterly data that means, that every quarter, new record come for each market .It is real estate dataset.
I am currently working with feature name Total_Unemployed and response vacancy. Help me understand how it works
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — this is a very insightful variable to study. Let’s go step by step so you get both economic intuition and modeling perspective for how Total_Unemployed interacts with vacancy_rate in your Moody’s real estate dataset.

🧠 1. Economic Intuition — How Total Unemployment Affects Vacancy Rate
🔹 Definition
Total_Unemployed = Total number of people in the labor force who are unemployed (typically reported quarterly).
vacancy_rate = Share of unoccupied real estate properties (apartments, offices, etc.) relative to total stock.

🔹 Core Relationship
There’s a negative economic linkage in most markets:

Economic Condition	Unemployment	Business/Income Effects	Vacancy Rate Impact
Economic growth	↓ (low unemployment)	More jobs, higher income, more leasing	↓ (lower vacancy)
Recession	↑ (high unemployment)	Fewer jobs, weaker demand	↑ (higher vacancy)
So, as unemployment rises, both households and firms reduce demand for property:

Residential: People delay moving, downsize, or double-up → more empty units.

Office: Companies freeze hiring or close offices → office vacancy spikes.

Retail/Industrial: Reduced consumption and production → lower space absorption.

This is why in econometric and forecasting literature, unemployment is often used as a leading indicator of future vacancy trends.

📈 2. Statistical/Modeling Perspective
When you model vacancy_rate as a function of Total_Unemployed, you can expect several key patterns.

a. Lagged Relationship
Vacancy typically reacts after unemployment changes (1–2 quarters later).
So add lag features:

df["Total_Unemployed_lag1"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].shift(1)
df["Total_Unemployed_lag2"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].shift(2)
Because leases expire gradually — vacancy rises after unemployment spikes.

b. Growth and Momentum Features
Instead of raw level, model trend or shock:

Quarterly change:
ΔUnemp = Total_Unemployed_t - Total_Unemployed_(t-1)

Percentage change:
Unemp_Growth = (Unemp_t / Unemp_(t-1)) - 1

Momentum:
MA_Unemp_4Q = rolling mean over last 4 quarters

Why? Because direction of change (improving vs worsening labor market) often matters more than absolute level.

c. Elasticity-Type Feature
To measure sensitivity between unemployment and vacancy:

Vacancy_Elasticity_to_Unemployment = (ΔVacancy / Vacancy_(t-1)) / (ΔUnemp / Unemp_(t-1))
This gives a dynamic elasticity — how strongly vacancy responds to unemployment changes per market.

d. Interaction Features
Vacancy sensitivity differs across property types:

Offices and Retail are more elastic to unemployment.

Industrial or Apartments are less elastic.

Hence, create interaction terms:

df["Unemp_x_PropertyType"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["property_type_encoded"]
This helps the model learn varying sensitivities.

e. Cross-Market Normalization
Each market’s unemployment base is different (NYC vs Austin).
Normalize by local labor force to get comparable metric:

Unemployment_Rate = Total_Unemployed / Total_Labor_Force
or use z-score normalization within each market:

df["Unemp_zscore"] = (Unemp - mean_market_Unemp) / std_market_Unemp
f. Cyclical vs Structural Effects
To separate short-term shocks from long-term structural labor issues, you can decompose unemployment into:

Trend (structural unemployment)

Cycle (business cycle effect)

Using a Hodrick–Prescott (HP) filter or rolling average.
Vacancy typically follows the cyclical component closely.

🧩 3. Advanced/Out-of-the-Box Features Used in Industry
Top real estate analytics firms (like CBRE, Moody’s Analytics CRE, and CoStar) also engineer these:

Job Loss Shock Indicator:
1 if unemployment jumps by more than 2 std deviations in a quarter — captures sudden distress periods.

Unemployment Recovery Duration:
Number of quarters since last unemployment peak — signals market recovery strength.

Unemployment-Employment Gap:
Difference between unemployment and employment growth — early warning for vacancy shifts.

Sectoral Exposure Weighting:
If you have employment by sector, weight unemployment impact by market’s exposure to sensitive sectors (e.g., tech, finance).

Rolling Correlation with Vacancy:
Dynamic correlation between past 4–8 quarters of unemployment and vacancy — useful as a meta-feature for regime shifts.

🧮 4. Modeling Tip
In your forecasting or causal setup:

Use lagged and growth versions primarily.

Apply market fixed effects to control for baseline differences.

Test Granger causality between unemployment and vacancy — often, unemployment Granger-causes vacancy.

Would you like me to show a list of advanced feature engineering transformations (code-ready) for Total_Unemployed — the kind you could directly plug into your dataset?
It would include growth rates, lags, rolling stats, shocks, interactions, and cyclical decomposition — all tailored to quarterly real estate data.

You said:
Help with out of box features engineering for this column.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — since you’re working on quarterly real estate data (Moody’s dataset) and the feature is Total_Unemployed, let’s focus on top-notch, out-of-the-box feature engineering that top-tier real estate analytics teams (like Moody’s CRE, CBRE Econometric Advisors, or CoStar) actually use in production forecasting and causal models.

We’ll go from basic enhancements → econometric transformations → advanced cyclical and behavioral features.

🧠 Feature Engineering for Total_Unemployed
⚙️ 1. Lag-Based Features (Economic Delay Effects)
Vacancy reacts after unemployment changes because leases expire or hiring decisions take time.

df["Total_Unemployed_lag1"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].shift(1)
df["Total_Unemployed_lag2"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].shift(2)
df["Total_Unemployed_lag4"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].shift(4)  # 1-year lag
👉 Captures delayed economic stress and pipeline vacancy effects.

📈 2. Change and Momentum Features
These reflect how fast unemployment is moving — markets respond to direction, not just level.

df["Unemp_QoQ_Change"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(1)
df["Unemp_YoY_Change"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(4)
df["Unemp_Momentum_4Q"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(4).rolling(4).mean()
df["Unemp_Acceleration"] = df.groupby("market")["Unemp_QoQ_Change"].diff()  # second derivative
👉 Detects early recession signals and turning points before vacancy shifts.

🧮 3. Smoothing & Trend Extraction (Cycle Detection)
Vacancy follows cyclical unemployment (business cycles), not random noise.

from statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter import hpfilter

cycle, trend = hpfilter(df["Total_Unemployed"], lamb=1600)  # quarterly data lambda
df["Unemp_Trend"] = trend
df["Unemp_Cycle"] = cycle
👉 Unemp_Cycle captures short-term shocks; Unemp_Trend captures structural weakness in labor market.

🔄 4. Shock Indicators (Stress Detection)
Identify abnormal surges or recoveries — real estate firms use these to tag stress periods.

df["Unemp_Shock"] = (df["Unemp_QoQ_Change"] > df["Unemp_QoQ_Change"].rolling(8).mean() + 
                     2 * df["Unemp_QoQ_Change"].rolling(8).std()).astype(int)

df["Unemp_Recovery"] = (df["Unemp_QoQ_Change"] < 0).astype(int)
👉 Marks quarters of mass layoffs or recovery onset — powerful for regime-sensitive models.

⚖️ 5. Elasticity Features
Real estate vacancy elasticity to unemployment gives interpretability and cross-market comparability.

df["Vacancy_Elasticity_Unemp"] = (
    df["vacancy_rate"].pct_change(1) / df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(1)
)
👉 A dynamic sensitivity metric — tells you how vacancy reacts to unemployment movements in each market.

🌐 6. Market Normalization
Markets like NYC and Austin have very different unemployment scales — normalize to control for size effects.

df["Unemp_zscore"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].transform(
    lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std()
)
df["Unemp_Ratio_to_Max"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].transform(
    lambda x: x / x.max()
)
👉 Aligns different markets to a common volatility base, enabling global modeling.

🧩 7. Interaction Features (Cross-Domain Relationships)
Because vacancy response depends on property type and economic exposure:

df["Unemp_x_PropertyType"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["property_type_encoded"]
df["Unemp_x_SP500"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["SP500_Price_Index"]
df["Unemp_x_RetailSales"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["Total_Retail_Sales"]
👉 Captures sectoral sensitivity — for example, high unemployment + low retail sales ⇒ major retail vacancy jump.

🕒 8. Rolling & Volatility Features
Captures market uncertainty — often a good predictor of delayed leasing decisions.

df["Unemp_RollingMean_4Q"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).mean().reset_index(0,drop=True)
df["Unemp_RollingVol_4Q"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).std().reset_index(0,drop=True)
df["Unemp_RollingCV_4Q"] = df["Unemp_RollingVol_4Q"] / df["Unemp_RollingMean_4Q"]
👉 High volatility often precedes leasing slowdowns and higher vacancy persistence.

📊 9. Relative Position in Cycle
Real estate models often benchmark current unemployment to its long-term average.

df["Unemp_to_10YAvg"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] / df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(40).mean())
👉 Tells how “tight” or “slack” the local labor market is vs. history — vacancy tends to rise above long-term unemployment average.

🔔 10. Composite Indicators
Combine unemployment with other signals to represent economic pressure:

df["Economic_Stress_Index"] = (
    0.5 * df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(4)
    + 0.3 * df["Public_Debt_to_GDP_Ratio"].pct_change(4)
    - 0.2 * df["SP500_Price_Index"].pct_change(4)
)
👉 Real estate forecasters use such synthetic stress measures to explain broad macro shocks on property vacancy.

🧩 Bonus: “Top-Notch” Advanced Ideas
These are less common but powerful in institutional forecasting pipelines:

Feature Type	Description	Why It’s Useful
Labor Tightness Index	Ratio of total job openings to total unemployed	Inverse predictor of vacancy; tight labor → low vacancy
Unemployment Shock Duration	Quarters since unemployment rate last peaked	Captures recovery maturity
Dynamic Cross-Correlation	Rolling correlation between Unemp and Vacancy over 8 quarters	Detects changing linkage strength between labor and real estate
Time-to-Recovery Score	# of quarters it takes for unemployment to fall 50% from last peak	Predicts pace of vacancy normalization
Would you like me to generate a ready-to-use Python feature-engineering template (like a function) that automatically computes all these transformations for Total_Unemployed per market, so you can plug it into your Moody’s pipeline?

You said:
Sorry I was asking can you look for some more top notch features engineering which top real estate industry use
ChatGPT said:
Great — digging deeper, here are some really advanced / “cutting-edge” feature engineering ideas that top real estate firms use (or could use) — especially in CRE forecasting, lease analytics, and vacancy modeling. These go beyond the more standard lag/growth/cycle features, aiming to capture structural risk, non-linear effects, competition, credit & financial stress, spatial spillovers, and behavioral / market expectations.

You can pick and adapt the ones that make sense given what data you have.

🚀 More Top-Notch Features Engineering Ideas
These are features that are often harder to build (data acquisition is tougher, or computationally more involved), but payout can be significant in forecasting / risk modeling:

Feature Idea	What It Captures / Why It’s Useful	Data Requirements / Challenges
Credit / Tenant Default Stress Indicators	Vacancies increase not only when demand falls but when existing tenants default or leave early (especially office, retail). If you have data on tenant credit scores / defaults / lease terminations, you can build features like “percent of leases in region in default or in trouble”, or “average credit rating of major tenants” per market.	Needs lease/tenant data or credit-score proxies; maybe from CMBS disclosures or leasing databases. Rare in many datasets.
Refinancing / Debt Maturity Vulnerability	When commercial real estate loans are coming due and interest rates are high, property owners may curtail investment; this depresses maintenance, leading to tenant exits, or delayed turnover → higher vacancy. Feature: fraction of commercial mortgages in a market (or dominant market) maturing in next 1-2 years, or average interest rate spread on CRE debt.	Need loan-level data or aggregated CRE debt statistics; often available through commercial mortgage databases or regulatory filings.
Financing Cost Shock	Interest rate changes or spreads (vs risk-free) affect both demand (cost of capital for developers) and supply (new construction cost). You can build features like: recent % change in CRE financing rates, or spread between CRE loan rates and treasury rates.	Requires financial market / bond market / bank lending rate data.
Regulation / Tax / Policy Shock Dummies	Zoning changes, tax incentives / changes, rent control laws, eviction moratoria etc. These can abruptly alter vacancy dynamics. Feature: dummy variable(s) for quarters when significant policy shifts occur in each market, or “effective tax rate / regulatory burden index” per market.	Requires collecting policy changes per jurisdiction.
Construction Pipeline & Inventory Pressure	New supply (under construction + planned projects) vs expected absorption: captures supply overshoot risk. Feature: “construction completions in next year as % of current stock”, “permits issued lagged”, or “planned inventory pipeline / expected deliveries” per market.	Need projects / building permit data; developer pipelines; sometimes proprietary or local planning agency data.
Lease Expiry / Renewal Risk Profile	CRE leases are usually multi-year. If many leases in a market are expiring in the upcoming period, then vacancy risk is concentrated. Feature: % of sq ft leases expiring in next 1-2 quarters; weighted average lease expiry (WALE) for major properties; renewal rate history.	Requires lease-level or building level data; sometimes difficult unless you aggregate via big landlord disclosures or databases.
Competitor / Submarket Spillover Effects (Competitive Pressure)	Vacancy in nearby markets/submarkets often influence vacancy in your market via migration of tenants or firms. Feature: a spatial average (or lagged average) of vacancy / unemployment / rent growth in neighboring or peer markets. Also “distance to nearest high-vacancy peer markets”.	Need geospatial mapping of markets / submarkets; adjacency or distance; and data for those neighboring markets.
Expectations / Sentiment Proxies	Real estate markets are forward-looking; sentiment around job growth, future supply, financing can drive preemptive vacancy changes. Possible proxies: index of real estate investor sentiment; Google Trends for “office vacancy” or “commercial real estate problems” in region; surveys of leasing agents; or forward price of rental futures (if available).	Data often unstructured or noisy; sometimes expensive; proxies might be weak but helpful.
Macro Shocks & Cross-Sector Risks	For instance, shocks in trade, supply chain, energy costs, inflation: these impact costs of operations, demand. Feature: oil price changes; inflation-adjusted commercial input costs; shipping / logistics cost indices; supply chain indices. Also general economic policy uncertainty (EPU) indices.	Macro economic data; matching frequency; adjusting for lags.
Labor Force Composition & Unemployment Quality	Not all unemployment is equal. The composition (by sector / skill / age) matters: e.g., unemployment in “office-using sectors” may have bigger vacancy impact than unemployment in non-office sectors. Feature: share of unemployed from office-using industries; or metric of structural vs cyclical unemployment; or youth unemployment share; or long-term unemployed fraction.	Sector-level unemployment data; detailed labor force survey info.
Price / Rent Affordability Indicators	If rents rise too fast relative to incomes / wages in the market, demand drops (or people move out). Feature: ratio of average asking rent to median household income; growth in rent inflation minus wage inflation; index of affordability.	Requires local income data; matching rent data; may vary by property type.
Vacancy Persistence / Hysteresis	Vacancy doesn’t always revert quickly; prolonged vacancy can lead to decay, undesirable class attrition, etc. Feature: number of consecutive quarters with vacancy above some threshold; exponential decay of past vacancy; or “vacancy momentum” (how persistent the high vacancy state is).	Just your vacancy data; but good to model non-linearities.
Seasonality / Holiday Effects	Some markets are seasonal (tourism, holiday rentals) or have regulatory seasons (budget cycles, fiscal years). Feature: seasonal dummies; interactions with quarters; or offsetting seasonality via moving averages.	Not too hard; need domain knowledge.
Spatial Demand Drivers	Proximity to transportation, infrastructure, amenities: new transit lines, highway expansions, airports. Feature: distance to nearest major transit hub; recent infrastructure investment in region. Also “walkability / transit score” if residential/multifamily markets matter.	Geospatial data; sometimes availability of infrastructure project schedules.
Demographic Pressure	Population growth or decline; migration in/out; household formation; age structure. Growth of young working population (or retirees) can shift vacancy. Feature: net migration, population growth rate; household formation rate; aging rate; ratio of working-age population.	Census or municipal sources.
Technology / Workplace Trends	E.g. remote work intensity; coworking utilization; collapse or expansion of certain office-using tech sectors. If you have data on how many firms are switching to remote / hybrid, or vacancy in coworking spaces, etc. Proxy feature: % of office demand in coworking; counts of remote job postings in a region.	Harder to get; proxies or survey info often needed.
Cost of Transport / Commute Times	As commuting becomes costly (gas, transit costs), tenants prefer closer / suburban locations or drop space. Feature: average commute time; transit cost inflation; fuel price changes; congestion indices.	Geospatial commute data; sometimes available from surveys or mapping companies.
Energy / Operational Costs	Rising electricity, heating, cooling costs affect occupancy (especially in low-insulated / old building stock), or tenant’s ability to pay. Feature: energy price indices; building age / efficiency rating; maintenance cost inflation.	Utility cost indices; building quality data.
Regime‐Switch / Breakpoint Detection	Vacancies often shift regime when certain thresholds crossed (e.g., unemployment > X, rent declines > Y). Build features that detect when market transitions from “normal” to “stress” regime (using change point detection), or “structural break” flags.	Statistical tools; requires good historical horizon; may need to balance false alarms.
✅ Suggestions for Which Ones to Prioritize
Given your Total_Unemployed feature and vacancy response, here are some features that tend to give the biggest lift in CRE / real estate vacancy modeling:

Supply pipeline / under-construction completions — Because oversupply creates lagged vacancy pressure.

Lease expiry / renewal risk — Especially if many leases are clustered in certain future periods.

Credit / refinancing stress — Especially in markets with high debt loads, or when interest rates are volatile.

Labor force composition — Unemployment by sector aligned with the property type (office vs retail vs industrial), as that shows where demand will weaken most.

Spatial / peer market spillovers — Vacancy in neighboring/submarket zones often predictive.

If you like, I can try to find concrete examples (academic papers or industry reports) where some of these features were used — and see if they match your data availability. Do you want me to pull those together?

Perfect 👌 — let’s take this even further and go deep into industry-grade, out-of-the-box feature engineering ideas with Total_Unemployed that top real estate economists and data scientists (like Moody’s CRE, CoStar, and CBRE Econometric Advisors) use to model vacancy_rate.

We’ll go beyond simple lags and growth rates — into structural, behavioral, spatial, and macro-interaction features that actually appear in enterprise-level modeling stacks.

🧩 CATEGORY 1 — Labor Market Dynamics (Advanced Transformations)
1. Unemployment Rate Shock Intensity
Instead of a binary “shock”, measure the magnitude of surprise:

df["Unemp_Shock_Intensity"] = (
    (df["Total_Unemployed"] - df["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).mean()) /
    df["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).std()
)
👉 Captures how extreme a rise in unemployment is compared to recent history — large positive values often precede vacancy spikes.

2. Duration of High Unemployment
Vacancy rates are “sticky” if unemployment remains elevated for long:

df["Unemp_High_Duration"] = (
    df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].apply(
        lambda x: (x > x.median()).astype(int).groupby(x.ne(x.shift()).cumsum()).cumsum()
    )
)
👉 Measures how long unemployment has been above median — prolonged stress leads to sustained high vacancy.

3. Unemployment Recovery Speed
Markets with faster recovery tend to stabilize vacancy quicker:

df["Unemp_Recovery_Speed"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"].shift(4) - df["Total_Unemployed"]
) / df["Total_Unemployed"].shift(4)
👉 High values = fast recovery → lower expected vacancy in future quarters.

4. Cumulative Unemployment Pressure
Integrate unemployment over time to represent total stress accumulation:

df["Unemp_Cumulative_Pressure"] = df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].cumsum()
👉 Captures multi-quarter build-up that explains long-term vacancy saturation.

📊 CATEGORY 2 — Structural Labor Features (Contextualized with Market Dynamics)
5. Unemployment-to-Employment Ratio
Balance indicator between working and jobless people:

df["Unemp_to_Emp_Ratio"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] / df["Total_Employment"]
👉 A cleaner measure than raw Total_Unemployed, especially across markets with different labor forces.

6. Unemployment Participation Ratio
Combines total unemployment with labor force participation:

df["Unemp_to_LaborForce"] = df["Total_Unemployed"] / df["Labor_Force"]
👉 Converts the measure into local unemployment rate, useful for cross-market comparability.

7. Sector-Sensitive Unemployment
Different property types respond to sector-specific unemployment:

df["Office_Unemp_Weighted"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["Share_Office_Employment"]
)
df["Retail_Unemp_Weighted"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"] * df["Share_Retail_Employment"]
)
👉 Reflects how unemployment in specific industries influences corresponding property vacancy.

🌍 CATEGORY 3 — Cross-Feature and Interaction Effects
8. Unemployment × SP500 Interaction
Combines labor stress and financial confidence:

df["Unemp_SP500_Interaction"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(1) * df["SP500_Price_Index"].pct_change(1)
)
👉 If unemployment rises and SP500 falls, vacancy risk amplifies — a double-shock scenario.

9. Unemployment × Interest Rate Interaction
Links unemployment with financing conditions:

df["Unemp_Interest_Spread"] = df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(1) * df["10yr_Treasury_Yield"]
👉 High unemployment + high rates → developers freeze investment → long vacancy persistence.

10. Unemployment × Population Growth
Demographic resilience offsets unemployment:

df["Unemp_Pop_Interaction"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(1) * df["Population_Growth_Rate"]
)
👉 Markets with population inflow may absorb vacancies even amid rising unemployment.

📉 CATEGORY 4 — Risk, Volatility & Persistence Indicators
11. Rolling Volatility of Unemployment
Measures market uncertainty:

df["Unemp_Volatility_4Q"] = (
    df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).std().reset_index(0, drop=True)
)
👉 Higher volatility → less predictability → developers hesitate → increased future vacancy.

12. Autocorrelation of Unemployment
Persistence of unemployment shocks:

df["Unemp_AutoCorr_4Q"] = (
    df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(4).apply(lambda x: x.autocorr(), raw=False)
)
👉 Sticky unemployment tends to correlate with sticky vacancy.

13. Unemployment Shock Recovery Duration
Time since unemployment peaked:

df["Unemp_Time_Since_Peak"] = (
    df.groupby("market")["Total_Unemployed"]
      .apply(lambda x: (x.index - x.idxmax()).days / 90)
)
👉 Indicates how far along the labor market recovery path the market is.

🧠 CATEGORY 5 — Economic Regime & Sentiment Features
14. Regime Switch Dummy
Classify periods into “expansion” vs “recession”:

df["Unemp_Regime"] = (df["Total_Unemployed"] > df["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(12).mean()).astype(int)
👉 Useful for non-linear or tree-based models that learn separate behaviors across regimes.

15. Job Confidence Proxy
Reverse unemployment growth (to act like confidence):

df["Job_Confidence_Index"] = -df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(4)
👉 When job confidence is high → vacancy tends to tighten.

🧮 CATEGORY 6 — Composite Indices (Industry Favorite)
16. Labor Market Stress Index (LMSI)
Combine unemployment, job growth, and wage data:

df["LMSI"] = (
    0.6 * df["Total_Unemployed"].pct_change(4)
    - 0.3 * df["Average_Wage_Growth"]
    - 0.1 * df["Labor_Force_Growth"]
)
👉 Used by industry to model “aggregate employment pressure” on real estate demand.

17. Unemployment Deviation from Equilibrium
Distance from long-term equilibrium (e.g., NAIRU-like):

df["Unemp_Deviation"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"] - df["Total_Unemployed"].rolling(20).mean()
)
👉 Reflects cyclical overhang or slack in labor market — great macro signal.

18. Structural vs Cyclical Split
Decompose with HP filter:

from statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter import hpfilter
cycle, trend = hpfilter(df["Total_Unemployed"], lamb=1600)
df["Unemp_Cyclical"], df["Unemp_Structural"] = cycle, trend
👉 Unemp_Cyclical → short-term shocks that drive vacancy rate changes.
👉 Unemp_Structural → slow-moving backdrop of local economy.

⚡ CATEGORY 7 — Market Spillover Features
19. Peer Market Average Unemployment
Vacancy often spills across cities:

df["Neighbor_Unemp_Mean"] = df.groupby("quarter")["Total_Unemployed"].transform("mean")
👉 Models regional contagion — when one market weakens, others follow.

20. Relative Unemployment Advantage
How a market compares to its peers:

df["Relative_Unemp_Index"] = (
    df["Total_Unemployed"] / df.groupby("quarter")["Total_Unemployed"].transform("mean")
)
👉 If a market’s unemployment is lower than average, it may attract tenants → lower vacancy.

🧭 Bonus: “Executive-Level” Real Estate Metrics (Inspired by Institutional Models)
Feature	Interpretation
Job Market Resilience Score	Combines volatility, trend, and recovery duration of unemployment
Labor Market Stress Elasticity	Measures how vacancy reacts to unit change in unemployment (rolling regression)
Macro-Vacancy Resilience Index	Weighted average of unemployment, GDP, retail sales, and interest rate growth
Labor Shock Synchronization	Correlation of local unemployment with national unemployment → measures integration risk
Would you like me to build a Python feature-engineering pipeline (a reusable function/class) that automatically computes all of these categories (lags, shocks, stress indices, volatility, interactions, etc.) for Total_Unemployed, per market and quarter?
That way, you can plug it straight into your Moody’s dataset pipeline.
